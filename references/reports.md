# Reports — publishing a rendered report to the workspace

A **report** is a JSON document this machine writes and the platform renders in the
web workspace's Reports list (「報告」 in the sidebar): KPI rows, charts, tables and prose, laid out by the web from
structured data — not a screenshot, not a wall of Telegram text. Use it for anything
the user will want to read again later: a performance review, a morning briefing on a
watchlist, an MCPT / research write-up, a post-mortem of a live week.

The platform pushes a short summary notification once the report is stored, so the
report reaches the user even when this machine is asleep — never send your own
Telegram message about a report as well, that duplicates every alert.

**Every report — `research`, `morning` (a morning brief, a close recap, a weekly, …) and
`performance` — can be shared publicly, and only by the user. A `performance` report goes
public with its account figures and positions in it.** In the workspace,
the report's title bar has a 「分享」 button; the user confirms each report on its own (a
consent checkbox, then confirm) and gets a link `blave.org/<lang>/r/<code>`. What is public is
a snapshot of the report at that moment: nothing written later changes it.
While a report is public its title bar shows a public status row instead; if the report
itself is rewritten afterwards (a same-turn correction, §1), the workspace adds a notice
with a 「檢查後更新公開版本」 button, which updates the public version under the same link. They can cancel at any time;
sharing again after cancelling gives a new link. The desktop app has the same 「分享」 button
in a report's header, for reports on this computer and on the cloud machine alike; sharing a
report on this computer uploads a snapshot of it, so editing or deleting the file afterwards
changes nothing public — only 「取消分享」 does. Deleting the cloud machine or the account
revokes every public link, including the ones shared from this computer. The platform does not review content: whether a report is fit to publish
is the user's call, made in the consent checkbox. Nothing you write into a report (including
`meta.shareable`, §7b B7) decides whether it can be shared, so never tell the user a report
cannot be shared, and never hold one back for that reason.
When the user wants to make a `performance` report public, do not talk them out of it and do
not refuse: it is their decision. You may say once, in one sentence, that the account figures
and positions in it become public with it (the confirm box says the same), then help with
what they asked.
**You cannot share, update or cancel a report for the user** — there is no API or tool for it
on this machine; point them to the button. Never promise view counts, a report-abuse flow,
takedown notices or anything else not described here.

§1–§6 are the **format** contract; **§7 is the content bar** — what a report has to
actually say to be worth reading. A report can satisfy every rule in §1–§6 and still
be worthless, so read §7 before you write the prose. A report you write by hand also
follows §7b: its presentation rules apply to every type but `performance`, and `research`
adds its own rules on top.

## 1. How to publish — the drop directory

Write the report to `workspace/reports/<id>.json`. That is the whole contract: no
token, no API call, no library needed. The runtime's uploader watches the directory
and ships whatever lands there.

- **`<id>` is the file name stem and the report id**: `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`.
- **A report is never overwritten.** Every report you produce is a new one. When the id
  you ask for already has a report, `write_report` / `publish()` write this one under the
  next free id (`research-btc-2`, `-3`, …; `…-2-auto` for a data-only id) and leave the
  earlier report and its `<id>.files/` exactly as they were. They return the path they
  wrote. The user sees titles and dates, never ids: **do not mention the id or the number
  in the reply**, and do not treat the new id as something to fix.
- **Correcting your own report, same turn only**: write it again with the same id and
  `replace=True`. That rewrites what *this turn* wrote under that id and nothing else —
  a report from an earlier turn, a scheduled run or another process is never replaced
  (the call then writes a new report). Without `replace=True` a correction is one more
  report in the user's list.
- **Changing a report the user named**: when the user points at one report and asks for a
  change to it (「把剛剛這份報告的標題改成…，其他不動」, rewrite one paragraph, fix a typo),
  change that report itself with `lib.report.edit_report`:
  `edit_report("<id>", title="…")`, or
  `edit_report("<id>", change=lambda blocks: blocks[3].update(markdown="…"))`.
  It keeps the id, `created_at` (the report stays where it is in the list) and the pictures,
  and touches nothing the change did not name. **Never edit `reports/<id>.json` by hand** —
  not with Python, not with an editor: that skips the checks, the schema version, the sweep
  of unused captures and the ledger (`.written.jsonl`, where the change is recorded as an
  edit with the time it was made). Changing a report does not make it this turn's: to change
  it again call `edit_report` again — `replace=True` still only rewrites a report this turn
  wrote, and on an earlier turn's report it writes a new one. A report nobody named is never
  changed; 「再做一份」 / 「重做」 / 「更新一下」 with new data is a new report. A report
  shared by public link keeps showing the version that was shared — the link is not
  updated by the change; the user updates it themselves with 「檢查後更新公開版本」 in the
  report's title bar. Say so only when the user asks about the link. `FileNotFoundError` = the report
  is no longer on this machine: say it cannot be changed from here and offer a new one.
- **Writing the file yourself** (no `lib/report.py`): pick an id that has no file in
  `reports/` or `reports/sent/`. A file written over an existing one replaces that report
  for good — that is the one way left to destroy a report, so do not.
- **Write atomically**: write `<id>.json.tmp` (any name not ending in `.json` is
  ignored by the scan) and `os.replace()` it into place. Belt and braces on top of
  that: the uploader leaves any report whose own mtime — **or that of any picture in
  its sidecar** — is younger than 2 seconds for the next tick, so a half-written file
  is never parsed.
- **Figures ride in a sidecar directory, `reports/<id>.files/`** — see §5. **Write the
  pictures first and the report JSON last**: the JSON landing is what makes the whole
  set visible, and by then everything it references is already on disk.
- The envelope `id` is filled in from the file name when absent; when present and
  **different**, the report is refused rather than guessed at.
- After upload the file moves to `reports/sent/` (last ~20 kept). A report refused
  for good moves to `reports/failed/`, with the reason appended to
  `reports/upload_errors.log` — the api's message names the offending field path
  (`blocks[3].items[1].value`), so read that file before rewriting anything.
  **The sidecar travels with its report** into either directory; a `<id>.files/` left
  behind with no report is swept a day later.

`lib/report.py` does the above for you:

```python
from lib.report import write_report, status

write_report(
    "mcpt-2317-20260901",           # id == file name; [A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}
    "2317 策略績效勝過 98.8% 的隨機排列",   # 1–200 chars; a research title states the finding (§7b)
    [                               # blocks — a meta block is prepended for you
        {"type": "text", "variant": "lead", "markdown": "p = 0.012, ..."},
        {"type": "kpi_row", "items": [
            {"label": "p-value", "value": "0.012", "tone": "neutral"},
            {"label": "Permutations", "value": "1,000", "tone": "neutral"}]},
    ],
    type="research",                # performance | morning | research
    report_type="一次性",            # header display string; defaults to `type`
    meta={"machine": "blave-agent-01"},   # optional meta props, see §3
    images={"perm.png": open("tmp/perm.png", "rb").read()},   # → <id>.files/, see §5
)

# Diagnosis only — never a step after write_report; see "The write is the finish line".
status("mcpt-2317-20260901")   # 'pending' | 'sent' | 'failed: <reason>' | 'unknown'
```

`write_report` checks only the report id and the image file names (a name is used to
write a file, so it must not be a path) — every other rule is enforced downstream,
where the error message is more precise than anything this side could reproduce. It
writes the pictures before the JSON, in the order the drop dir requires. For
`type="research"` it also prints advisory `WARNING:` lines from §7b (title too long, no
`kpi_row` right after the lead, no `meta.shareable` — B7). They never stop the write.

**The write is the finish line.** Once the JSON is in the drop dir the report is
produced and you are done — tell the user it has been produced and will show up in the
Reports list (「報告」 in the workspace sidebar) within about two minutes, then move on.
Never say it is already in the list: the upload has not run yet, and the platform can
still refuse it. **The chat reply is one
or two sentences: the conclusion and the one thing to watch.** The report is the record; do not
restate it in chat — no bullet list, no figure the report already shows (its lead and KPI row
are right there), no status line about the run (「Published successfully.」). In the desktop app
a card under your reply opens the report: say it is ready, never that it is open. Shipping it is the runtime's job: a 2-minute
timer picks the file up, so in the normal case the report appears within about two
minutes. **Do not poll `status()`, and do not wait for `pending` to turn into `sent`
before replying** — every extra tool call there is the user paying to watch a timer that
has not fired yet. **Never read `reports/<id>.json` back to check it either**: the uploader
may already have moved it to `reports/sent/`, and the `FileNotFoundError` you get is the
upload working, not a failure. If you need the document again, open
`reports/sent/<id>.json`; `write_report` prints the same line.

`status()` is a diagnostic for afterwards — the user says the report never showed up,
or you have reason to think it was refused. That is the failure worth knowing about: a
report whose format the api rejects moves to `reports/failed/` with the reason appended
to `reports/upload_errors.log` (the message names the offending field path), and it will
never arrive on its own. You do not have to go looking: the runtime puts a refused
report in front of you at the start of your next turn — tell the user then. `'unknown'` is not a failure — it also means "sent a while ago
and already pruned from `sent/`".

Old BlaveClaw machines (pre-Blave-Agent runtime) have no uploader; files just
accumulate in `reports/`. If `reports/sent/` does not exist on this machine, do not tell
the user the report will appear in the Reports list.
The sidecar is newer than the rest of this page: a runtime that predates it passes a
`file` field straight through to the api, which refuses it as an unknown prop. If a
report lands in `failed/` for that reason, this machine's runtime is too old — upload
the picture yourself and reference it by `sha256` (§5), or leave it out.

## 1b. Templates — the data half is already written

### Report flow — search first, then build (every report but a backtest report)

A report is not a fixed form: it is built around what actually happened today. For **every**
report — the market briefs, 台股收盤報告, 單標的晨報, a custom recipe, a research report, and the
unattended turn of a scheduled report — work in this order. The one exception is a backtest report
(its content is the backtest; no news search, no market extras — say an obvious anomaly in the
narrative instead). A research question runs its data check before step 1 (§1b › *Research
questions*): that probe decides whether there is a report at all.

1. **Search first** (fast, ~15 s): the news and events in the report's window (§1b › News).
2. **Pick 1–3 things that are special today** from what you found — a hacked exchange, a listing
   or unlock, a policy decision, a stock's earnings. Nothing special → skip to 3 with no extras.
3. **Build once**: the default recipe **plus** bricks for those things, in one call —
   `crypto_market_brief(extra=[["coin_snapshot", {"symbol": "BGB"}], ["exchange_snapshot", {"exchange": "okx"}]])`.
   Any template or `build(recipe, extra=…)` takes `extra`. Event bricks: `coin_snapshot(symbol)`
   (90 daily candles and volume against its 20-day mean), `exchange_snapshot(exchange)` (that exchange's 24h
   liquidations, open interest, BTC funding — only exchanges Blave collects; others become a note),
   `relative_to(symbol, benchmark="BTC")` (never the benchmark against itself),
   `liq_map(symbol)` — a coin's liquidation profile over a continuous price axis (`bar_chart`
   variant `profile`, contract 1.5): solid bars = force orders that happened in the last 24 h
   (each bucket keeps both sides — `neg` = long liquidations/red, `pos` = shorts/green, never
   netted; ×3.3 Binance-share scaling), dashed line = the model-estimated exposure from leaderboard positions —
   an estimate, never real orders, and the caption says so. Use it when the story is leverage,
   liquidations or a cascade; any other brick works too (`price_chart` of a Taiwan
   stock, `tw_institutional(symbol=…)`). **At most 3 extras, each one fetch**; at least one of them
   is about the thing your lead is about. `publish` checks this: news that names an instrument with
   good or bad news, and no extra built, gets a refusal naming the exact `extra=[…]` to rebuild with
   (a Taiwan stock: `["tw_institutional", {"symbol": "2409"}]` or its `price_chart`; the report's own
   coin: `relative_to`; another coin: `coin_snapshot`). `narrative["no_extra"]` (one sentence) is only
   for a brick that cannot be built — no data for it — and never covers an instrument your lead /
   read / summary talks about: if you argue from it, show it (外資大砍友達 → 友達's 外資買賣超; a DOGE
   ETF closing → DOGE against BTC). What the data sources do not have degrades like any brick
   (`pack.missing` / notes) — never fetch it by hand.
   **A brick about one instrument names it.** Every block title of a single-instrument brick
   starts with the instrument (`2330 台積電 外資近 10 日賣超 …`, `SOL 資金費率 …`; the id alone when
   no list knows the name), and outside that instrument's own report its KPI label and
   `describe()` key carry it too (`2330 台積電 外資買賣超`, in 張) — 「外資買賣超」 with no
   instrument in front is always the whole market's (億元). Cite each under its own name; never
   write a stock's 張 as the market's flow. In `symbol_brief` / `research_pack` the KPI row and
   the keys stay bare (every cell is that instrument).
4. **Write the narrative**: the lead states the most important thing today (usually the one you
   built extras for); run down the checklist `describe()` prints.
5. **Publish once**, with the conclusion as the title (`title=…`). If `publish` refuses, it lists every
   problem at once: fix them all and re-send the **same pack** — `publish("<report id>", narrative, title=…)` — never call the template again (the
   pack is kept for this turn only, at most 10 minutes; the next turn builds afresh because the market has moved; rebuilding is slow and its live figures move under your narrative, which
   the number check then refuses). A second identical template call within 10 minutes returns the
   kept pack anyway (`fresh=True` rebuilds).

A research report (`write_report`, no pack) follows the same order: its extras are the blocks you
build from `lib.data` for today's event, each source cited in the `footnote` with its `url`.
Target: the whole report in about two minutes.

For the four template types (three morning briefs and the 台股收盤報告) the deterministic half lives in `lib/report_templates.py`.
A template fetches every series through `lib.data`, builds the KPI row, charts, tables and
the footnote in contract shape, and hands back a `Pack` with the figures it used
(`pack.context`) and the narrative slots left for you (`pack.slots`). You add the
judgement; you do not touch the blocks.

A template is a **recipe** — a list of **bricks** with parameters (`RECIPES` in
`lib/report_templates.py`, the bricks in `lib/report_bricks.py`). A brick fetches one piece,
lays out 0–2 blocks with a conclusion `title` and a basis `caption`, adds KPI cells and
`describe()` lines, and takes the same two roads for missing data as before
(`pack.missing` / `pack.notes`). A request no template covers is built from the nearest
recipe, not by hand (§1b › Custom recipes).

```python

```

- `crypto_market_brief(symbols=("BTC", "ETH", "SOL"))` — KPI row (BTC, ETH, 24h liquidations,
  BTC funding, 市場方向, 頂尖交易員曝險), then: price / 1·7·30-day returns of `symbols` plus the
  five largest coins by market cap; the derivatives table (OI 24h change, funding, Binance
  account long/short ratio — directions, never coloured as gains); 24h liquidations by exchange;
  the day's movers (Binance's 100 most-traded perps, top / bottom 5, + Blave 異常漲跌); the
  market-wide Blave indicators (90-day chart; `lookback_days` only sets the N of the N-day
  return column); the **news slot** (below); today's macro events.
- `tw_market_brief()` — KPI row (加權指數, 成交值, 外資, 融資, 外資期貨, 夜盤), then: the TAIEX
  chart (last 90 sessions, the same as 收盤報告), 三大法人,
  the 10 largest 成交值 of the last session, 外資期貨淨部位, the day's 重大訊息, the **news slot**,
  and today's macro events with 除權息. 融資 is a KPI only (its chart stays in 收盤報告). The
  成交值 table and 重大訊息 come straight from TWSE open data and exist on the desktop only
  (`BLAVE_AGENT_LOCAL=1`); on a cloud machine they are absent and named in `pack.notes`.
- `symbol_brief("2330")` — Taiwan stock: close / volume / 外資買賣超 (張), recent highs / lows and
  moving averages (table 「近期高低與均線」: 前 20 日高/低 = the high / low of the 20 sessions before
  today, today excluded, so only today's bar can sit beyond it; 5/20/60 日均);
  `symbol_brief("BTC")` — crypto perp: price, funding, 爆倉 / 巨鯨 / 多空力道. Daily chart: 90 bars
  (`research_pack`: 120).
- `tw_close_brief()` — 台股收盤報告, for any 台股 收盤 / 盤後 request: the day's TAIEX close,
  turnover, 三大法人, 融資 and 外資期貨淨多單, with the same four slots and every rule on this page
  that applies to `tw_market_brief`. Its id is `tw-close-YYYYMMDD` (Taipei date), its own
  series next to that day's morning brief. The night session is not part of it; a question about
  tonight's 夜盤 is answered on its own, labelled as live. 三大法人 / 融資 / 期貨法人 are published
  after the close, at different times; one that is not out yet is absent and named in
  `pack.notes`. Say it is not out yet; never quote the previous day's figure as today's. Asked in chat
  on a non-trading day (weekend, or a row in the TWSE holiday table), it builds the last trading
  day by itself — do not ask first — and `describe()` says so: the lead or the first sentence of
  your reply says 「今天休市,用 9/24 的資料」 (a 台股大盤晨報 on a closed day works the same way).
  A scheduled run on such a day, and any request before today's close has landed, gets
  `pack.skip`: `describe()` gives the reason and the last trading day, and `publish()` writes
  nothing and returns None. Tell the user that; do not hand-write a substitute. There is no sector breakdown. A report that cites the holiday table (「9/25
  中秋節休市」) copies its attribution into the footnote verbatim (`references/lib.md` ›
  *Taiwan market calendar*). A skip on a holiday-table day ends with that attribution
  (also `pack.context['休市表出處']`); a reply telling the user the market is closed carries
  it verbatim too.
- **Missing Blave data is not a reason to withhold the report.** On a desktop without Blave data
  access (not signed in, no card, no balance) every Blave-only series — 資金費率, 市場方向, 資金稀缺,
  頂尖交易員曝險, 爆倉 / 巨鯨 / 多空力道, 外資買賣超, 今日總經事件 — raises `DataAccessError` inside the
  template and is left out like any other absent series: no KPI, no chart, and `pack.missing`
  lists each one with the reason (`signed_out` / `no_data_access`); `describe()` prints them.
  The price half still builds — crypto klines come from Binance's public endpoint, a Taiwan
  stock's daily bars from its own exchange (`fetch_twstock_price`, with the exchanges'
  attribution line added to the footnote) — so you `publish()` as usual: it appends one footnote
  line naming the missing series and what restores them (`lang="en"` for the English wording).
  In the reply, name what is missing under the runtime's data-access rule — once per
  conversation, no card, no directions; how to restore it is the footnote's job, not yours.
  Do not build the missing blocks by hand and do not stop at "here is what is missing" with
  no report written. The two TAIEX briefs (`tw_market_brief` / `tw_close_brief`) take their
  index, turnover, 三大法人, 融資 and 期貨法人 straight from TWSE / TAIFEX on the desktop
  (`BLAVE_AGENT_LOCAL=1`, in a chat turn and in a scheduled job alike) and add both exchanges'
  attribution lines to the footnote; the TXF night session has no key-free path and goes to
  `pack.missing`, and without the holiday table 收盤報告 judges the trading day by today's index
  close. A scheduled job has no per-turn flag: `lib.data` reads "no access" from the Blave key the
  app keeps in `.env` (absent, or rejected with 401 / 403 `ERR007` / `ERR005`). **On a cold cache
  the first desktop TAIEX brief takes several minutes** (twse.com.tw is throttled to one request
  every 3 s, 三大法人 and 融資 are one request per trading day): run it with a Bash `timeout` of
  300000 or more, never in the background — an interrupted backfill is thrown away. Only on a machine
  without that flag (cloud) does a TAIEX brief with no Blave data come back with `pack.skip` set
  and `publish()` write nothing — tell the user that in one sentence.
- Slots: `lead` becomes the opening card (one falsifiable claim, ≤600), `read` (判讀) the one
  section after the data (≤300), `watch` the 觀察重點 table, `summary` the 「總結」 section just
  before the footnote (≤200, required), and `risk` (≤100) its last sentence — there is no separate
  risk box. **A cap is the target, not room to fill** — `publish` raises past it,
  naming how many characters over you are; cut, do not summarise the summary. *Why:* four
  generous slots produced a wall — 80% of readers are gone by 350 words (Axios), and the blocks
  already carry every number with its baseline.
- **`read` is skimmed, not read — 3–5 items, in one of two forms,** and `publish`
  refuses anything else:
  - 3–5 `- ` bullets, each carrying **one number and the baseline it is read against**; or
  - 3–5 `### ` sub-headings that each state a claim (「### 外資買超集中在電子權值股」, not
    「### 籌碼面」), a sentence under each.

  A range, not a fixed count: some days have three things worth saying and some have five.
  The 300-character cap is what keeps the range honest — five items means five short ones.

  Never prose, never a mix of the two: 300 characters of unbroken paragraph is shorter than
  the old wall and just as unscannable. `publish` puts the `## 判讀` heading above the slot,
  so your own headings inside it are `### ` (§4 renders both). *Why:* a reader finds things in
  a report by scanning, and that only works when the point is in the bullet or the heading.
  Same bar as §7b A6 / A7.
- **`watch` is a table, not prose** — 2–3 rows of `(條件, 門檻, 現在值)`, each cell ≤40 chars,
  passed as Python tuples (see the example above). `publish` builds the 觀察重點 `table` block
  from them (a string in this slot is refused). One row = one condition, its threshold, and
  where that number stands today; the reasoning belongs in `read`. A condition whose 現在值 you
  cannot state is a condition you cannot watch — drop the row. Thresholds stay indicator /
  籌碼 conditions, never a price (the rule below).
- **`summary` closes the report** (1–3 sentences, ≤200, required on every narrated report —
  briefs, 收盤, single-coin, research, custom): what the reading adds up to (the "so what") and
  what to watch next — the **one** most important row of the 觀察重點 table, not the table again —
  in words other than the lead's. `publish` refuses a missing one, one that repeats the lead (its
  first sentence copied, or most of its wording shared) and one that walks through several watch rows.
- **`risk` is one falsifiable sentence** (≤100), printed as the summary's last paragraph behind
  the prefix 「推翻條件：」 that `publish` writes (do not write it yourself, and do not say it again in
  `read`): the
  indicator threshold that voids the `lead`. **It hits the judgement in the conclusion, not the
  opposite market move** — 「觀望性拉回、未見恐慌」 is voided by panic (融資大減、期貨空單大增、外資連續大賣),
  not by 外資 turning to buy (that is a rebound); 「外資轉賣」 is voided by 外資 turning back to buying,
  not by 「外資連兩日賣超逾 300 億」 (that confirms it). Write it as 「若…,這個判斷就不成立。」
- **The title is the conclusion** (`publish(pack, narrative, title="…")`, ≤40, required whenever
  you narrate): 「外資轉賣 338 億,指數仍站 60 日均之上」, never the template name. A report about
  another day than today (a 收盤報告 run on Saturday for Thursday) gets the day added by `publish`
  — 「9/24 收盤｜…」 in the title and 資料日 in the header — so do not write the date yourself.
- **The blocks already carry their own baselines — do not re-state them in prose.** Every
  chart and table in the pack has a `caption` holding its measurement basis *and* the figure
  it is read against (前 20 日高, the 20-session average, the previous 10 sessions), and the
  `kpi_row` and the first chart (the price chart where there is one) state the day's headline
  fact in their `title` (「加權指數 +1.78%,高於前 20 日高 0.94%」), the `收盤位置` line in
  `describe()`. `describe()` prints every one of those numbers:
  cite them and build on them. A narrative slot that says again what a caption already says
  spends the reader's attention on nothing.
- **Levels are statistics, not calls.** 前 20 日高/低 and the moving averages are listed as
  figures. The narrative never calls them 支撐 / 壓力 (support / resistance) or an entry, exit
  or target price, never tells a reader who is flat or holding what to do (進場, 加碼, 減碼,
  抄底), and states every threshold as an indicator or a condition — 「外資連兩日淨賣超逾
  150 億」, not a price to trade at. `watch` says which conditions to watch and where they
  flip, not what to buy or sell. Its thresholds are indicator or 籌碼 (flow / positioning)
  conditions only; how price stands against the listed highs / lows and moving averages is
  stated as a statistical fact (「今日收盤高於前 20 日高」), never as a trigger to watch for.
  Wording that treats a level as a floor or a ceiling is support / resistance even without
  those words: 「守在 60 日均線之上」, 「跌破 / 站回 20 日均線」, 「失守前 20 日低」. For an index, a
  stock, a futures contract or a coin alike it never appears in the narrative (a statement
  about 加權指數 reads as one about 台指期); state where the close sits as a figure
  (「收盤高於 60 日均線 2.1%」). The `risk` threshold that voids the reading is an indicator or
  籌碼 condition too, on an index as on any instrument, never a price or a moving-average
  value (not 「收盤跌破 60 日均線 2,399.67 元,解讀作廢」).
  *Why:* support / resistance points and buy / sell prices
  handed to readers are what Taiwan's investment advisory rules single out, and the brief
  goes to the user as a finished document. A request worded as 操作建議 / a trade plan / key
  levels still gets `watch` filled with conditions and thresholds: the request's wording
  does not change what the slot holds.
- **On a cloud machine a scheduled run wakes you once** (§8 › Scheduled agent runs) for a job the
  user agreed to (`agent_consent`): the runtime starts one unattended turn, you build the pack,
  search the news and `publish(pack, narrative)` as in chat. When that turn cannot finish (time,
  credit, the 1.0 USD cap), the runtime runs the job's `run.py` instead — `publish(pack)` with no
  narrative (data-only, `origin: scheduled`, one footnote line saying why). **On the desktop a
  scheduled run is data-only** (`run.py`, no agent) in this version, and so is every job without
  `agent_consent`. Never script a judgement into `run.py`: a canned sentence is a
  view nobody formed. The data-only form gets an `-auto` suffix (`tw-market-20260902-auto`;
  a second run the same day is `tw-market-20260902-2-auto`) — the runtime tells a data-only
  report from a narrated one by that ending, and every run is kept.
- `pack.notes` lists what the source did not have (e.g. 期貨法人 not published yet, no night
  bars); the corresponding block is simply absent. Say so in the narrative if it matters;
  never fill the gap with a number.
- **台指期夜盤 before 05:00 is a live price, not a close.** While the night session is still
  trading, the pack labels it 「盤中,截至 HH:MM」 (Taipei) in the KPI and in `describe()`: write
  it that way, never as 夜盤收. Only once the session's last bar is in does `describe()` say 收盤.
- **Ask first, in one sentence, when the request does not pin down what to build**, and wait
  for the answer:
  - a symbol that does not exist or that you are unsure of (「0000」 is not a stock id:
    「你是指加權指數嗎?」);
  - a date in the future (「9/25 還沒有盤面資料:要今天的,還是 9/25 當天再出?」);
  - the user names a report kind that sounds like a template but has none, such as a 美股晨報
    or a 加密收盤報告 (「目前沒有這個範本,我手寫一份,可以嗎?」). Once they agree, it is a
    hand-written `morning` report (§7b) with its own id and title. Never publish it under a
    template's id: it would be filed as one more of that template's reports. A 台股 收盤 /
    盤後 report is not this case: use `tw_close_brief`.

  A research report or a report the user describes in their own words (their own 週報) has
  no template by design — build it from bricks (§1b › Custom recipes), do not ask.

### Research questions — straight to a report, after a data check

**What goes straight to a report** — decide before you start, from the question alone:
- The answer needs an analysis script over multi-period history: an event study, 「X 發生後 Y 怎樣」
  (「外資淨空單創新高後台指期一個月漲跌」), conditional returns (「資金費率轉負時 BTC 之後 7 天」),
  a comparison of two or more periods or groups (「2022 空頭和 2024 多頭時誰的回撤大」).
- Or the user asks for a new research report outright (「做一份…的研究報告」, 「…做成報告」, the
  desktop app's 新增報告 box). 研究 or 分析 on its own is not a trigger — judge the question by
  what its answer needs. A template brief (台股收盤報告 …), a backtest report or a change to an
  existing report is not this rule (AGENTS.md › Reports).

**What stays in chat:** one number (「台積電今天收盤多少」), a current reading (「BTC 資金費率現在多少」, 「幫我分析現在 BTC 的資金費率」 — 分析, but a reading),
a follow-up on an answer or report you already gave (「那 ETH 呢」, 「第二段是哪幾天」).

**Order:**
1. **Data check** — a probe, before the web search and before the analysis script: fetch the
   series with `lib/data.py` and print three things — the first and last date it holds against
   the period asked, how many times the condition occurs in it, and how many independent segments
   those occurrences form (B9). Nothing is said to the user yet.
2. **It passes** (the question as asked, enough segments to compare) → one line, then build:
   「這題會直接做成報告，約 N 分鐘」 / "This one goes straight into a report — about N minutes." —
   about 8–12 minutes in practice. No confirmation round: the user asked the question, the report is
   the answer. Then the report flow above (search first), the analysis script in `tmp/research/`
   (below, kept), and a `research` report (§7b B).
3. **It fails** → answer in chat, no report — also when the user asked for a report outright
   (the 新增報告 box included): never publish the original question as asked when the data cannot
   answer it, and never publish the changed one before the user accepts it.
   - The question has to change to be answerable — another threshold, another period, a proxy
     series. Say in the first sentence what was asked and what you answered instead
     (「三天都高於 0.05% 在資料裡沒有發生過，改用前 10% 的費率當門檻」), then the answer.
   - Or the condition holds in only a few segments — say how many, give the figures, and say what
     that many cannot show.
   - Offer the report **on the changed question**, naming the change: 「用前 10% 門檻做成報告」
     (a few segments, nothing changed: 「做成報告」). Web / desktop: a `<suggest>` line, never a
     question at the end of the reply. Telegram has no `<suggest>`: one plain sentence —
     「要的話回覆『用前 10% 門檻做成報告』」. The script stays in `tmp/research/`, so taking the
     offer reruns it (*Research scripts*, below).
   - **Taking the offer is the user's consent to the change:** the changed question is now theirs,
     and the report's title, lead and every block answer it — not the original.
   - **Never publish a report on a substitution the user did not accept.** A report is read later,
     out of this conversation; its title would answer a question nobody asked.

*Example that stays in chat:* an event study of BTC after funding above 0.05% for three days in a
row — the condition never occurs in the data, so the agent swapped in a top-10% threshold and
answered in chat. That is the right call: the question changed.

### Research scripts — kept in `tmp/research/`, rerun for the report

A research question that passed the data check is already a report (above); this flow is for an
answer that stayed in chat. When the user turns an earlier chat answer into a report (「做成報告」, 「把剛才的分析整理成報告」),
the new turn sees only the text of your earlier replies — not the scripts, tool calls or their
output. The research is already done; the script that did it is the way back to its figures.
This is the one exception to AGENTS.md's "delete your `tmp/` scripts before you reply".

**Keep the script behind every research answer.**
- One question, one script: `tmp/research/<what_it_computes>.py` (`foreign_net_short_event_study.py`,
  never `test2.py`). A revised analysis is saved over the same file — no `_v2` / `_verify` / `_final` trail.
- First line: `# <the question it answers> | <data and window, e.g. TXF 外資淨空單 2015-01-05..2026-10-07> | <written YYYY-MM-DD>`.
  It prints every figure the answer quotes.
- No API key, secret, token or password is ever written into the file — it stays on the
  machine. Blave data: `from lib.report_templates import headers_from_env`; an exchange key: read
  from the workspace `.env` the way `lib/` already does (`dotenv_values()` handed to the lib
  function, `references/lib.md`), never pasted in.
- Run it from the workspace root as `python3 -m tmp.research.<name>` (no `.py`; the folder needs
  no `__init__.py`) — it imports `lib` whether or not the machine sets `PYTHONPATH`.
- Probes and one-off prints around it are still deleted before you reply.
- **Cap:** at the start of a research or report turn, keep the newest 20 files in `tmp/research/` and delete
  the rest — nothing else ages them, on the desktop app or in the cloud. Run exactly this, from the
  workspace root (only `tmp/research/*.py`, never `__pycache__` or anything outside):
  `python3 -c "import glob,os; fs=sorted(glob.glob('tmp/research/*.py'), key=os.path.getmtime, reverse=True); [os.remove(f) for f in fs[20:]]"`

**Making an earlier answer into a report:**
1. `ls -t tmp/research/` (ignore the `__pycache__` folder it lists) and read the first lines; pick
   the script whose question is the one the user means.
2. **Rerun it, do not copy it.** Add what the report needs on top — the baseline series a chart
   draws, the KPI figures — in that same file. If it no longer runs because `lib/` changed, write
   it again from `references/lib.md` (same name, same first line) instead of patching the old code.
3. Build the blocks from that output and publish once. Nothing in `tmp/research/` matches (an older
   machine, or the answer came from `python3 -c` calls) → do the research once, in one script saved
   there, and say nothing about it.

### News — every report you write in chat looks for it first

**A report the user asks for in chat is researched on the web before you write it**: the two
market briefs, 台股收盤報告, 單標的晨報, a custom recipe, and a research report. The one
exception is a backtest report (a strategy's performance / backtest write-up): no news search.
Look for what happened in the report's window (a brief: since the last close; a research
report: the period it covers) about the instruments it names, then the wide-impact events.

Where the news goes:

- **A template or a custom recipe** (anything you `publish()`): the `news` slot. Every pack takes
  it. On `tw_market_brief` / `crypto_market_brief` the block sits where the recipe puts it and
  `describe()` lists the licensed candidates (Taiwan: 鉅亨 headlines since the last close, needs
  Blave data access; crypto: none — there is no licensed crypto source); on the other templates
  it goes after the data blocks. You searched and found nothing → `"news": []`, and the footnote
  says so in one line.
- **A research report** (hand-written blocks, `write_report`): cite every source you used in the
  `footnote`, one item per source, with its `url` (§3 `footnote`; same link rules as `news`), and
  mark the claim it supports with `[^id]`. A news item the analysis rests on is cited the same way.
  Do not hand-build a `news` block.

What channel you search with depends on where you run:

| Where | What you do |
|---|---|
| Desktop app (`BLAVE_AGENT_LOCAL=1`) with the browser tools mounted (`mcp__blave_browser__*`, `references/browser.md`) | Search and read with the built-in browser (any model). For headlines: `browser_open` a news list page → `browser_read(part="links")` → `browser_read(part="meta")` on the few you keep for the published time → `part="section"` only for the paragraph a figure comes from. Do not read whole articles. |
| Desktop app without those tools (the user switched the built-in browser off, or it could not be attached this turn) | No web at all, by any route — the runtime's *No web access* rule. The `describe()` candidates only (Taiwan market brief), or `"news": []` with `few_sources` saying the built-in browser is off; the reply says no news was looked up. |
| Cloud machine, Claude model | The web search tool (billed per search from the user's credit, `references/billing.md`). |
| Cloud machine, DeepSeek | No web search tool — read with WebFetch, starting from your market's list. Taiwan: 鉅亨's licensed list page `https://news.cnyes.com/news/cat/headline`, the links on the `describe()` candidates (鉅亨's licensed feed), TWSE announcements `https://www.twse.com.tw/rwd/zh/news/newsList?response=json` and TAIFEX announcements `https://www.taifex.com.tw/cht/11/announcement`. Crypto: 鉅亨's licensed list page `https://news.cnyes.com/news/cat/bc_crypto`, Binance announcements `https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement` and OKX announcements `https://www.okx.com/help/section/announcements-latest-announcements`. Each fetched with a short prompt. Any other news site is fine too (CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, Decrypt, 經濟日報, MoneyDJ). Fewer than 3 sites: one sentence in `few_sources`, publish anyway. |
| Scheduled run | Cloud, a job with `agent_consent`: you run as in chat in an unattended turn (§8), same rows as above. Desktop, or no consent, or that turn failed: the data-only `run.py` lays out the licensed headlines as they are (no summary, no tag). |

When no channel gives you anything, still write and publish the report: `"news": []` (the footnote
says there was no source) or, for a research report, no news citation. A model with no web tool at
all degrades the same way — the news block is simply absent, with one footnote line; that is the
product's behaviour, not a fault. Never tell the user to switch model or buy anything for it, never
compare model prices over it, and never hold the report back waiting for news.

```python
publish(pack, narrative={
    "lead": "...",
    "news": [
        {"title": "台積電 9 月營收年增 38%", "summary": "月營收創單月新高，年增近四成。", "tag": "pos",
         "sources": [("鉅亨", "https://news.cnyes.com/..."), ("TWSE", "https://www.twse.com.tw/...")],
         "published_at": "2026-09-25 18:30", "symbols": ["2330"]},
        {"title": "聯準會理事：降息仍需更多數據", "title_orig": "Fed governor says more data needed", "title_orig_lang": "en",
         "summary": "理事認為通膨尚未穩定回落。", "tag": "neutral",
         "sources": [("Reuters", "https://www.reuters.com/...")], "published_at": 1790330400},
    ],
})
```

- **Collect** only news inside the report's window (a morning brief: since the last close).
  Any public site may be a source, in chat and in a scheduled report alike. A page the browser
  refuses (`blocked_policy`) → use another source. Never exchange / broker back offices or banks.
- **`symbols` on every item**: the instruments it names (`["XRP"]`, `["2330"]`) — the extra-brick
  check reads them (it also spots common coin tickers and names in the title and summary).
- **At least three sites**: read at least 3 different sites and give the news at least 3 different
  sources; `publish` asks for more when they come from fewer than 3 sites (or one sentence in
  `narrative["few_sources"]` saying why no more could be found).
- **Time**: `published_at` is the article's time (`'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'` Taipei, or unix seconds). A page that
  gives only a date → pass the date alone (`'2026-09-25'`): it is stored as a day and shown without a time,
  never as a made-up 00:00.
- **De-duplicate**: one event is one item; several outlets reporting it go into that item's
  `sources` (1–3), `published_at` = the earliest. `publish()` refuses a repeated link and a
  near-identical title.
- **Read lean**: never `browser_read(part="full")` for news or research. `part="meta"` (title, time) →
  `part="outline"` → `part="section"` for the one paragraph you need — about 3,000 characters per page,
  20,000 per report. With web search, read the result snippets first and open a page only to check a
  figure.
- **Open what you will read, read what you opened**: `browser_open_many` takes only the pages you
  are going to read, and every page it opened is read (`part="meta"` at least) before you write the
  narrative. A page you will not use is not opened; one you opened by mistake is closed
  (`browser_close`). The user sees every page that opened and takes it for a source.
- **The original first; second-hand is marked**: for news and for every number, read the outlet's
  own article or the official page. A forum post (CMoney 同學會, PTT, Dcard, Reddit, X), a repost,
  a summary of someone else's article or an aggregator page is used only when the original cannot
  be found or opened — and then it is marked: in a `news` item the source name ends with
  `（轉述）` (`("CMoney 同學會（轉述）", "https://…")`), in a research footnote the item says
  `轉述自 <who>`. A number that exists only second-hand is written with 「據…轉述」 in the sentence.
- **Source quality, in this order**: mainstream financial and crypto media (Reuters, Bloomberg, CNBC,
  CoinDesk, The Block; for Taiwan 鉅亨, 經濟日報, 工商時報, MoneyDJ), official announcements
  (the project, the exchange, the regulator; for Taiwan TWSE / TAIFEX announcements), exchange research reports > aggregators > press-release
  sites (openPR, GlobeNewswire, PR Newswire) and SEO / price-prediction sites (247wallst-style "X price
  prediction", exchange blogs selling a coin). **A price-prediction article is never a source**; a press
  release is only a source for what the issuer itself announced.
- **Pick** ≤5: items naming this report's instruments first, then wide-impact ones (macro,
  regulation, exchange events), single small names last.
- **Title**: a Chinese headline as written, unless it is over 40 characters — then rewrite it
  shorter, keeping its facts (the desktop app shows titles in full, it does not cut them); a foreign one → your Chinese translation in
  `title`, the original in `title_orig` and its language in `title_orig_lang` (`en`, `ja`…).
  One translation only.
- **Summary**: one sentence, ≤40 characters, your own words — never the article's sentence.
  A number in it must be written in the article itself: not from a search snippet, not from
  memory (search snippets and memory have both been wrong, see `references/lib.md` › Macro
  facts). Unsure of a number → open the article and check; cannot open it → write the summary
  without the number. No advice wording (可望, 值得布局, 建議加碼, 目標價…; a fact like 「外資加碼台積電」 is fine) — `publish()`
  refuses it.
- **Tag** answers one question: is this news good or bad **for the instrument it names**?
  `pos` / `neg`; no single instrument named, or unsure → `neutral`. It is not a price call.
  Tags are display only: never add them up into a direction, never use one as a `watch`
  threshold or the `risk` signal, and they never become a `lib.data` series.
- **Links**: every item you found on the web carries at least one `https://` link to the
  article. A `describe()` candidate you keep is `channel="licensed"` and may have no link.
- **The narrative does not repeat headlines.** `read` may cite one item as the cause of a
  figure, and then writes the figure too.
- The block title is set for you (「新聞 · 綜合 N 家」 with ≥3 outlets, else 「新聞 · 」 and the outlet names), and
  so is the footnote line (「新聞為 agent 於 HH:MM 蒐集整理；標籤依事件性質分類，不是股價預測」).
- The 重大訊息 block (desktop) is built by the brick, tagged by the announcement's clause only.

### Rules for writing on the pack (R1–R10)

- **R1 Every number comes from a brick.** Each figure in the data blocks and in the narrative
  can be found in `describe()`. A figure no brick has → add or swap a brick; never fetch,
  compute or take it from a search result yourself. The one exception is a news summary, whose
  number is quoted from the linked article (R5).
- **R2 Conclusion first.** `lead` states one falsifiable claim (R9 S1), in chat and in a
  scheduled agent run alike. The data-only fallback's only conclusion is the `kpi_row` title the
  brick computes; never script a judgement into `run.py`.
- **R3 No price levels to trade at, no advice** (the rules above). News tags are not added up
  and are not thresholds; summaries carry no advice wording; no heading or label says 關鍵價位,
  支撐 or 壓力.
- **R4 At most 8 data bricks** (the KPI row not counted), **at most 16 blocks** (cited images
  not counted). Extra information goes into a scannable table, not a paragraph. To cut, drop
  the bricks the lead does not use first; never the ones the user asked for — a cited image
  the user asked for is never what gives way. `check_recipe` refuses a 9th brick; going over
  16 blocks only prints a note for you and the report is written as it is.
- **R5 News**: every report written in chat searches first — the two briefs, 收盤報告, 單標的晨報,
  custom recipes, research; never a backtest report. Collect, de-duplicate, summarise, tag, cite
  — the section above. Tags stay display only (not summed, not a threshold, never a data series),
  and a news summary never gives advice (R3).
- **R6 Missing data is said once.** The footnote names what is missing; in the reply, once, under
  the data-access rule. Never withhold a report because Blave data is missing. No news channel
  → no news block, one footnote line, no advice to change model.
- **R7 Building a custom report**: start from the nearest recipe. Decide the lead's claim first,
  then keep only bricks that serve it — each brick is cited in `read`, holds a `watch` row, or
  was asked for by the user. One fact, one brick; one price chart per report. A report with the
  user's positions (`performance`) never also carries news bricks — make two reports.
- **R8 Ask one question first** (on top of the cases below) when: the user wants something no
  brick or source has (US single-stock news, ETF flows, token unlocks) — 「目前沒有這塊資料，先不放它，其他照做，可以嗎？」;
  a brief and the user's positions in one report — 「放持倉的話這份就不能分享，要拆成兩份嗎？」;
  more than 8 bricks — list the ones you would drop. The news search itself needs no question:
  do it (R5); ask only when the user plainly wants no web in this report. A **scheduled** report on
  a cloud machine — say what each run costs before they confirm, with `lib.report.scheduled_cost()`:
  「排程時我會自己上網整理新聞、寫判讀，依你當時用的模型每份大約扣 {low}–{high} 點（現在的模型是這個數）；
  每份上限約 40 點，超過或餘額不夠時只出數據版。這樣可以嗎？」 Only on a yes, register with
  `agent_consent=True`; a no is a data-only job. Such a job fires at most hourly (one fixed minute
  in the cron). Where `lib.report.scheduled_agent_available()` is False — the desktop, or a trial /
  one-slot cloud machine — ask nothing: say the scheduled version is data only. When the machine's
  current model has no web tool at all (neither search nor fetch), say once
  「這台目前的模型不含上網查新聞,這個排程會出數據＋判讀版」 — never a suggestion to switch model,
  never a price comparison; the run still happens and the report still goes out.
- **R9 Readable and shareable** (a research report adds the stricter §7b form of S1 / N3 in
  A2, of W1 in A9 and of W3 in A11; a template brief keeps these as written here):
  - S1 the lead's first sentence (up to the first 「。」) stands alone: ≤40 characters, at most
    one comparison (≤2 numbers), never only figures — it is the list summary, the notification
    and the share card's description. The rest of the figures go in sentence two.
  - W1 a number has one home: the narrative writes new comparisons or the "so what", never a
    figure the KPI row or a caption already shows.
  - W2 each `read` item opens with its conclusion in bold, the figure after a colon:
    「- **賣壓沒有量**：成交值只有 5 日均的八成。」
  - W3 a Blave indicator's first appearance carries its plain reading — the bricks put it in the
    KPI delta (「0 = 歷史平均」, 「正 = 淨多」); do not add an explanation paragraph.
  - W4 Chinese uses full-width punctuation. `publish()` converts `,` `:` `;` `()` next to Chinese
    in your narrative (numbers, times, links and `code` stay as they are); write it right anyway.
  - W5 the 「總結」 closes every report, and `risk` — the signal that voids the reading, pointing
    the other way from it — is always its last, falsifiable line.
  - N1 chart titles are conclusions the bricks write (「融資 928.0 萬張，比 20 日均多 17.4 萬張」);
    captions hold the basis and the baseline.
  - N2 the chart your lead argues from goes first: `narrative["lead_chart"] = "<brick>"`
    (`describe()` lists the bricks with a chart).
  - N3 per sentence at most 2 numbers and 1 baseline; big numbers in 萬 / 億 / 兆; ratios as
    「幾成」「幾倍」.
- **R10 Automatic checks** — `publish()` refuses, naming what is wrong and by how much:
  the lead's first sentence (R9 S1); a figure written with decimals that is within 2% of a
  `describe()` figure of the same unit and precision but not equal (「ETH +7.36%」 against
  +7.26% — a copying slip; a rounded figure or a clearly new comparison passes); the news
  items (count, one sentence ≤40, https link, duplicates, window).

### Custom recipes

A report the user describes in their own words is built from bricks, starting from the nearest
recipe — never as hand-written blocks with numbers you fetched yourself (R1).

**Start from `quickstart()`, not from this file.** `python3 -c "from lib.report_templates import
quickstart; quickstart()"` prints the fixed order of work, the recipe shape, every brick with its
arguments and the signatures of `research_pack` / `build` / `publish` — taken from the code, so it
is never behind. The rest of this section is reference for when something is refused.

```python
from lib.report_templates import RECIPES, build, publish, check_recipe
from lib.report_bricks import BRICKS          # the catalogue; each brick's docstring lists its parameters
recipe = {"id": "btc-derivs", "title": "BTC 衍生品晨報", "lookback_days": 90,
          "kpi": ["price_chart", "liquidation"],                      # KPI order, the first is the focus
          "bricks": [["price_chart", {"symbol": "BTC"}], ["derivs_table", {"symbols": ["BTC", "ETH"]}],
                     ["liquidation", {"hours": 24}], ["levels_table", {}]]}
pack = build(check_recipe(recipe))
print(pack.describe())
publish(pack, narrative={...})
```

**Answer the question the user asked, in its window and its shape.**
- The window is theirs: 「這週」 is 7 days — `derivs_table(window="7d")` (each coin's own 7-day OI
  change, funding as its 7-day mean), `liquidation(hours=168)`; never a 24-hour figure standing in
  for a week. A window no brick has is computed from the series and said in the narrative with its
  basis, not swapped for the nearest one.
- A comparison of several instruments is one chart with every series on it plus one comparison
  table — `funding(symbols=["BTC", "ETH", "SOL"])`, `relative_perf(symbols=[…])` (rebased to 100),
  `derivs_table(symbols=[…])` — never one chart per instrument.

The id must not start with a built-in prefix (`tw-market`, `tw-close`, `crypto-market`,
`symbol-`). To schedule it, save the recipe next to a fixed `run.py` (§8):

```python
from lib.report_templates import save_recipe, RECIPE_RUN_PY
from lib.report import register_schedule
save_recipe("btc-derivs", recipe)            # report_jobs/btc-derivs/recipe.json (checked)
register_schedule("btc-derivs", "BTC 衍生品晨報", "<the user's words>", "30 8 * * *", "每天 08:30",
                  RECIPE_RUN_PY)
```

A scheduled recipe runs like any scheduled job (§8 › Scheduled agent runs): on a cloud machine with
`agent_consent` you narrate it in an unattended turn; otherwise, and whenever that turn fails, its
`run.py` publishes the data-only form.

**Running a script that imports `lib`.** Python puts the directory of the script it runs on
`sys.path`, not the current directory, so `python3 tmp/make_brief.py` fails with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'lib'` even from the workspace root (seen on Linux and
Windows machines alike, on the first run of nearly every report). Any of these works on both:

- `python3 -m tmp.make_brief` (module name, no `.py`) from the workspace root;
- `python3 -c '…'` from the workspace root;
- a script that pins the workspace before its first `from lib…`: `import os, sys` then
  `sys.path.insert(0, os.getcwd())` when you start it from the workspace root, or
  `sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))` in a
  script one directory down (`tmp/x.py`), which then runs from any directory.

Headers, if you need `lib.data` outside a template: `headers_from_env()` in the same module
reads `blave_api_key` / `blave_secret_key` from the workspace `.env` (see `references/lib.md`).

## 2. Envelope

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.1",
  "id": "wk-2026-08-31",
  "type": "performance",
  "title": "績效週報 08/25–08/31",
  "created_at": 1756684800,
  "blocks": []
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | string | `"1.6"` when an `image` block carries `source` (§5 › Citing an image from the web); otherwise `"1.5"` when a `bar_chart` has `variant: "profile"`; otherwise `"1.4"` when the report has a `news` block, any block with `private`, or a footnote item with `url`; otherwise `"1.3"` when the `meta` block carries `shareable` or `involves_futures` (`true` **or** `false`, §7b B7; 1.3 also covers `candlestick`); otherwise `"1.2"` when the report contains a `candlestick` block; `"1.1"` otherwise. `write_report` sets it for you; hand-written JSON must follow the same rule — anything under a version older than the one that introduced it is refused. |
| `id` | string | `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`, equal to the file name stem. |
| `type` | string | `performance` / `morning` / `research` — report list grouping. **Hard rule: any report that carries the user's account assets, positions, orders or live strategy P&L is `performance`, even when it is shaped as a morning brief or a close recap.** All three types can be shared publicly by the user. Only a `performance` report keeps its `private` blocks on the public page, and only its confirm box tells the user that account figures go public — so a wrong `type` either shares account numbers without that notice or drops them from the public page. |
| `title` | string | 1–200 chars. |
| `created_at` | int | **unix seconds, UTC** — never milliseconds, never a string. |
| `blocks` | array | 1–120 blocks. |

Whole document ≤ **2 MB** (bigger is refused, not truncated).

## 3. Blocks

A block is `{"type": "<key>", ...props}`. The array is flat — blocks never nest.
**An unknown type or an unknown prop is refused (400), not ignored**: a typo in a
field name loses the report, so copy names from this page rather than inventing them.
Any block but `meta` and `footnote` may carry `private: true` (1.4): the public share page
of a `research` or `morning` report drops that block whole; the public page of a
`performance` report keeps it, because the account figures are the report. A block that
shows the user's holdings, cost prices or account figures is `private` — and such a report
is `performance` anyway (§2).
Strings are ≤200 chars unless stated. `?` marks optional.

Most visual blocks (`kpi_row`, all charts, `metric_table`, `table`, `code`, `image`)
also accept `title?` (≤80, the section heading above the block) and `caption?` (≤300,
the small print below it — put the measurement basis there).

**In a template brief neither is optional.** `lib/report_templates.py` writes a `caption` on
every chart and table it builds — the measurement basis **plus** the baseline the figure is
read against (§7b A3) — and writes the day's headline fact into the `title` of the `kpi_row`
and of the first chart (the price chart where there is one), which is the only conclusion a
data-only scheduled run carries (§1b).
The one exception is a block that measures nothing (the 今日總經事件 schedule): basis alone,
because it has no baseline and a made-up one is worse than none. The standard holds for a
chart you build by hand too: a caption that says again what the chart already draws is not a
caption.

| Block | Required props | Limits / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `meta` | `title`, `report_type`, `generated_at` | **Exactly one, always first.** Optional: `period` `{from, to}` display strings ≤32 (`"08/25"`), `account` `{aum: number, currency}`, `benchmark`, `origin` (`scheduled`/`chat`), `machine`, `extra` (≤3 `{label, value}`), `shareable` (boolean, `research` only — §7b B7); `involves_futures` is still accepted but read by nothing, so leave it out. `period` + `account` + `benchmark` + `extra` ≤4 header cells in total. |
| `kpi_row` | `items[{label, value, tone}]` | 1–6 items; **the first is the focus** and renders largest. `label` ≤40, `value` a formatted string, `tone` = `pos`/`neg`/`neutral` (unsigned numbers such as Sharpe or win-rate are `neutral` — a wall of green means nothing). Optional `unit` ≤16, `delta`. When there is a `delta` the tone colours the delta, not the value, so a cell whose `delta` is a baseline (「平常 +4.3%」) is `neutral` (§7b A4). |
| `line_chart` | `series[{name, role, points}]` | 1–4 series; `role` = `primary` (solid, **at most one**) or `benchmark` (dashed); `points` = 1–5000 `[t, v]`, `t` unix seconds int — the **real date** of that observation, never a stand-in (below) — `v` finite number. Optional `y_unit` (≤8, see *Axis units* below), `bands` (≤2 `{from, to, label}`, unix seconds, label ≤32) and `reflines` (≤4 `{y, label, emphasis}`, `emphasis: true` = red loss level). |
| `candlestick` | `candles` | 2–120 bars `[t, open, high, low, close]`; `t` unix seconds int, **strictly increasing**; the four prices finite numbers with `low ≤ min(open, close)` and `max(open, close) ≤ high` on every bar. Optional `y_unit` and `reflines` (≤4 horizontal price levels such as the prior 20-day high/low), both exactly as on `line_chart`. No `bands`, no volume pane, no moving-average overlay. The x-axis is one slot per bar, not real time (no weekend or overnight gaps), so it does **not** line up date-for-date with a neighbouring `line_chart` / `drawdown` — expected, not a bug. Needs `schema_version` `"1.2"` or later. `lib/report_templates.candlestick(title, df, y_unit=…, reflines=…)` builds one from an OHLC DataFrame. |
| `drawdown` | `points` | 1–5000 `[t, v]`, `t` the real date as on `line_chart`, `v` a **negative percent** (−9.84 = −9.84%). Optional `maxdd` `{value, from, to}` (unix seconds). No unit field — the contract pins this chart to negative percent. |
| `heatmap` | `variant`, `values` (+ `rows`,`cols` or `labels`) | `variant` = `calendar` (needs `rows` ≤40 years, `cols` ≤20 months — an annual / total column goes in `cols` too) or `matrix` (needs `labels` ≤40, values −1…1). `values` is 2-D, shaped rows×cols / labels×labels; `null` renders as an em-dash (future months, the diagonal). Optional **`emphasis_cols`** (**calendar only**): unique integer indices into `cols` marking the columns to render with added weight — that annual / total column. The web cannot tell which column is the total (`cols` is plain strings and not every calendar has one), so say it here. On a `matrix` heatmap `emphasis_cols` is an unknown prop → refused. |
| `bar_chart` | `variant` + `items` or `segments` | `variant` = `bars` (`items` ≤60 `{label, value}`, signed, zero axis) or `stacked` (`segments` **2–4** `{label, value}`, value ≥0, normalised into widths). Only four category colours exist, so a 5th segment would repeat one. **Merging the tail into an "Other" segment is your decision, not the web's** — it cannot know which segments to fold or how to say so; fold them here and explain the fold in `caption`. No unit field on either variant. |
| `histogram` | `bins[{x0, x1, count}]` | 1–200 bins, `x0 < x1`, `count` a non-negative int. Optional `x_unit` / `y_unit` (≤8, see *Axis units*) and `reflines` ≤4 `{x, label, emphasis}` (vertical). |
| `box` | `groups[{label, min, q1, median, q3, max}]` | 1–40 groups, label ≤40, the five numbers monotonically non-decreasing. Optional `outliers` ≤50 numbers and `y_unit` (≤8, see *Axis units*) — there is **no `x_unit`**: the x-axis is the group labels, not a numeric scale. State the whisker basis (P5–P95 or true extremes) in `caption` — no field carries it. |
| `scatter` | `points[{x, y}]` | 1–2000 points; optional per-point `label` and `role` = `focus`/`context` (omit `role` everywhere for a single population). Optional `x_unit` / `y_unit` (≤8, see *Axis units*) and `regression` `{slope, intercept}` — put slope / R² in the `caption`, they are not drawn. |
| `metric_table` | `items[{label, value}]` | 1–60 pairs; `label` and `value` are both strings ≤60, `value` already formatted. Label-value grid, no header row. Optional per-item `format` = `text` (default) / `number` / `percent` / `date` — the same field name and the same four values as a `table` column, and **the same colour gate, see below the table**. The grid has no columns, so it hangs off the item instead. |
| `table` | `columns[{key, label, align}]`, `rows` | ≤20 columns; `key` = `\w{1,40}` — letters of any script (Chinese included), digits, underscore; no spaces or punctuation — unique within the table; `label` ≤40; `align` = `left`/`right`/`center` (numeric columns are always `right`); optional `format` = `text` (default) / `number` / `percent` / `date` — **it gates the up/down colouring, see below the table**. ≤500 rows, values string / number / `null` (→ em-dash). **A row key not declared in `columns` is refused.** |
| `text` | `markdown` | ≤20000 chars, subset in §4. Optional `variant: "lead"` — the opening conclusion card: **at most one, and it must be the block right after `meta`**. |
| `quote` | `text` | ≤500; optional `cite` ≤120. Pull quote — only a sentence already made in the body, ≤2 per report. |
| `footnote` | `items[{id, text}]` | 1–30 items; `id` = `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,32}`, unique in the report; `text` ≤1000; optional `url` (1.4) — the source's page, same link rules as `news`. **At most one footnote block, and it must be the last block.** |
| `news` | `items[{title, sources, published_at}]` | 1.4. 1–10 items (a brief uses ≤5). `title` ≤120 — the displayed title: a Chinese headline as written, a foreign one as your translation; `title_orig?` ≤120 — the original foreign headline, only when `title` is a translation, with `title_orig_lang` — its language as a short BCP-47 tag (`en`, `ja`, `zh-Hans`, ≤8; required with `title_orig`, refused without it); `summary?` ≤80 (the rule is one sentence ≤40, your own words); `tag?` = `pos`/`neg`/`neutral` (shown as 正面消息 / 負面消息 / 中性); `sources` 1–3 `{name ≤40, url?}`; `channel?` = `licensed` / `web`; `published_at` unix seconds; `symbols?` ≤5 × ≤16. **Links:** `url` is `https://`, names a host, carries no user name or password, ≤500 characters, no spaces — anything else is refused with the field path. Built by `publish()` from the news slot (§1b › News); do not write one by hand. The public share page shows it as it is. |
| `code` | `lang`, `source` | `lang` = `[A-Za-z0-9+#_.-]{1,20}` (`text` when there is no language); `source` ≤20000. |
| `divider` | — | No props. **Neither de-duplicate them nor judge whether one belongs**: the web omits a divider whenever the next thing already opens itself (a block `title`, a markdown H2/H3, the head or foot of the report, a `footnote`, a second adjacent divider). Drop one wherever a break reads right; **a divider you inserted that does not appear is the expected outcome, not a bug** — do not go hunting for it. |
| `callout` | `tone`, `text` | `tone` = `warning`/`info`; `text` ≤2000; optional `title` ≤120. |
| `image` | `file` **or** `sha256`, plus `alt` | **Exactly one of the two references, never both** (both = refused here on the machine). `file` = a plain file name in `reports/<id>.files/` — `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,79}`, never a path; the extension picks the MIME type (`png`/`jpg`/`jpeg`/`webp`/`gif`) and each picture is 1 byte–2 MB. `sha256` = `[0-9a-f]{64}` of an image already on the platform (§5). One name referenced by several blocks uploads once. `alt` ≤200 is **required** (accessibility, no default). Optional `caption` ≤300. Optional `source` `{name ≤40, url}` (1.6) marks a **cited** image — a chart captured from a web page — and nothing else; rules in §5 › Citing an image from the web. The platform adds `url` and the pixel `w`/`h` when the report is read back — **never send `w`/`h` yourself**, they are unknown props and the report is refused. |

**Price is drawn as a `candlestick`.** Any price chart in a report — an index, a stock, a
coin — is a `candlestick`: never a `line_chart` of closes, never an `image` of a matplotlib
plot. Daily candles: 90 bars by default, up to 120 in a research report (120 is the hard limit). Past
~72 bars a phone-width view draws high-low lines instead of full candles — expected; do not shorten for it. Half a year or more is a trend, not candles —
use a `line_chart` of closes for that. **The chart kind follows the series kind, never taste**
(the bricks have it fixed — `lib/report_bricks.CHART_KIND` — and a hand-built series follows the
same table): a per-period flow (liquidation USD, net buying, volume — one bar = how much happened
that period) is a `bar_chart`; a level or an indicator (open interest, margin balance, net
positions, funding, long/short ratio, any z-score, equity) stays `line_chart`. The web dashboard
draws the same data the same way (`chart_type` history vs line) — a report must not disagree with it.

**An x-axis that is not calendar time is never a `line_chart` / `drawdown`.** "Day N after the
event", "trading days held", a rank or a bucket has no date, and encoding it as one (day 0 =
2020-01-01, day 5 = 2020-01-06, …) prints invented dates such as 01/05 and 02/09 on the page
and the share card, with overlapping ticks. Draw it in a block whose axis is labels:
a `bar_chart` (`bars`) with one bar per window (`第 5 日`, `第 20 日`, …) of the **excess** return —
event minus baseline, so the zero axis is the baseline and the caption says so — plus a `table`
with event / baseline / difference columns per window; or the `table` alone. `bars` holds one
series, so event and baseline side by side are two `bar_chart`s, never one.

**Numbers vs display strings — the mistake to check for first.** Chart data
(`line_chart` / `candlestick` / `drawdown` / `heatmap` / `bar_chart` / `histogram` / `box` / `scatter`
coordinates and values) must be **real numbers** — the web computes scales from them.
Display fields (`kpi_row.items[].value`, `metric_table.items[].value`, `table` cells)
must be **already-formatted strings** (`"+1.82%"`, `"24,318.77 USDT"`): thousands
separators, sign and decimals are decided here and printed verbatim. Every number must
be finite — `NaN`/`Infinity` is refused (`lib/report.py` raises on them locally).

**Axis units.** `line_chart`, `candlestick` and `box` take `y_unit`; `histogram` and `scatter` take `x_unit`
and `y_unit`. Each is a display suffix of ≤8 chars (`"%"`, `"USDT"`, `"bp"`) printed on the axis
labels — it never converts or scales the numbers in `points` / `bins`. Nothing else carries
the unit: the web cannot tell a percent series from an equity-in-USDT one, and guessing `%`
would turn your data into a false statement. Omit it and the axis prints bare numbers.
`bar_chart` and `drawdown` have **no** unit fields at all (`drawdown` is fixed to negative
percent by the contract), and **`box` has a `y_unit` but no `x_unit`** — its x-axis is the
group labels, a category axis with nothing to suffix. A unit field on a block that does not
declare one is an unknown prop and loses the report.

**Colour is gated by `format` — in `table` columns and `metric_table` items alike — and that
makes the sign your job.** Only a column or an item declared `number` or `percent` gets
up/down colour, and the judgement is purely the **first character of the displayed string**:
`+` renders green, `−`/`-` renders red, anything else stays neutral. `text` (the default) and
`date` are never coloured, in either block. The web deliberately does not read the `label` to
infer meaning — a keyword rule would break across languages and custom names. The gate cuts
both ways, and the two halves are complementary:

- **A signed value that is not a profit or a loss stays neutral by staying `text`.** `Net
  Exposure` shown as `+0.62×` is a direction, not money made or lost; leave it at the default
  and the `+` prints with no green tint. Reach for `number` / `percent` only where the sign
  really does mean gain or loss.
- **A figure whose value is positive but whose meaning is negative — VaR, Max DD, worst loss,
  largest adverse excursion — is written with a negative sign here** (`"−1.12%"`, not
  `"1.12%"`). That is not cosmetic; P&L-facing figures are stated as their effect on equity,
  so a loss carries a minus.

There is no per-cell or per-item `tone` field and none is coming.

**Spacing and signs in display strings — a house style, not a validated one.** The web picks
which fragments of a string to set in the monospace face from the shape of the string itself, so
how you write it changes how it reads. This applies to `kpi_row`'s `value` / `unit` / `delta`,
`metric_table`'s `value`, `table` cells, and the prose in the narrative fields.

- **A word unit takes one space between it and the number**: `+0.88 pp`, `2 bp`,
  `24,318.77 USDT`, `120 次`.
- **A symbol unit takes none and stays glued to the number**: `+1.82%`, `+0.62×`, `±20`.
- **U+2212 (`−`) is the preferred minus — a typographic preference, not a requirement.** In the
  monospace face U+2212 is the same width as `+`, so the positive and negative values in one
  column line up. An ASCII hyphen (`-`) behaves **identically** in every other way: the same run
  goes mono, and it takes the same semantic colour (the colour gate above already reads `−` and
  `-` alike). Emit whatever your program prints by default — **do not add a character-replacement
  pass for this**.
- **A numeric range reads best with an en dash**: `5–10` is treated as one numeric fragment,
  where `5-10` sets only the first half in mono.

**Ignoring this costs the typeface and nothing else.** A missing space leaves that run in the
regular face — the value is still correct, the colour is still correct, and the report is not
refused. `validate_report()` does not look at spacing, minus signs or dashes, and no api error
will ever name them. Write to it as a convention, not as a gate to clear.

## 4. Markdown subset (`text.markdown`)

Only these render; anything else shows up as plain text.

| Syntax | Renders as |
|---|---|
| `## Heading` | section heading with a hairline rule |
| `### Heading` | sub-heading |
| `**bold**` | bold (no colour change) — see the note below |
| `*italic*` | italic — for Chinese emphasis use bold instead |
| `- item` | bullet list |
| `1. item` | numbered list |
| backtick-wrapped text | inline code chip |
| `[^id]` | footnote reference — `id` **must** match an `items[].id` in the report's `footnote` block, or the report is refused |

Not supported: tables (use a `table` block), images (use `image`), links, H1, H4+,
block quotes (use `quote`), raw HTML.

**Bold: a matched pair of `**` is always bold.** CommonMark's flanking rules are *not*
applied — under those rules a closing `**` followed by fullwidth punctuation
(`**先觀察一週**。`) is not a closing delimiter and the asterisks print literally, which
would penalise ordinary Chinese sentences. The web pairs them up before rendering
(asterisks inside inline code and `code` blocks are left alone). **Do not reword a
sentence or move punctuation to make bold work** — write it the natural way.

## 5. Images

Charts belong in chart blocks — the web draws them from the data series, so they stay
readable and themed. The `image` block is for a figure that cannot be expressed as
data (a matplotlib research plot, an annotated diagram).

The report JSON never carries image bytes. There are two ways to point at them.

**The sidecar — the default, and the only one that works from a scheduled script.**
Put the file in `reports/<id>.files/` and name it from the block:

```
workspace/reports/
  mcpt-2317-20260901.json          {"type": "image", "file": "perm.png", "alt": "..."}
  mcpt-2317-20260901.files/
    perm.png
```

`lib/report.py` does this for you — pass `images={"perm.png": <bytes>}` to
`write_report` and it writes the sidecar before the JSON, which is the order the drop
dir requires (§1). The uploader then sends the bytes, hashes them and rewrites `file`
into the `sha256` the platform stores. **Use this whenever you can**: a strategy
subprocess is started with every `BLAVE_*` variable stripped, so a scheduled script
holds no machine token and cannot upload anything itself — and the long-tail research
figure produced on a schedule is exactly what this block exists for. The producer
needs files, nothing else.

**Uploading yourself.** From a context that does hold the machine token — or for a
picture already on the platform, such as a backtest chart — PUT the bytes and
reference the hash:

```
PUT https://api.blave.org/openclaw/agent/strategy_image/<sha256>
    Content-Type: image/png            # png / jpeg / webp / gif
    x-api-key: proxy-<machine token>
    body: the raw bytes
```

The path `<sha256>` must be the sha256 of exactly those bytes (a mismatch is refused),
which is what makes re-uploading an unchanged image a no-op. Then use
`{"type": "image", "sha256": "<same hash>", "alt": "..."}`. Never put `file` and
`sha256` on the same block — two references cannot both be the picture, and the
machine refuses the report rather than choose.

### When an image fails

Three outcomes, and which one you get depends on who made the mistake and whether
retrying would help:

| What happened | What the machine does |
|---|---|
| **You wrote it wrong** — no such file in `<id>.files/`, an extension that is not an image, empty or over 2 MB | The **whole report** goes to `failed/` with the reason in `upload_errors.log`. Nothing is degraded and nothing is guessed at: a report referencing a picture that does not exist is broken the same way an `[^id]` pointing at no footnote is, and you should hear about it now rather than ship a document with a hole in it. Fix the file, write the report again. |
| **Something transient** — the file cannot be read this tick (a lock, a virus scanner), the upload connection fails, the tick's time budget runs out | The report **stays in the drop dir** and is retried with backoff (60 s up to an hour). The image is **not** dropped: it will go up on a later tick, and losing a figure permanently to save a few minutes is a bad trade. Nothing for you to do. |
| **The image storage quota is full** (the api answers `507`) | That one `image` block is **removed and the report ships without it**, with a line in `upload_errors.log`. This is the only case that neither clears by retrying nor is your fault — holding the report back would mean it never arrives at all. Do not leave the user staring at a gap: the 507 is recorded on the machine and you should say in chat that a figure was left out because their image storage is full. |

**A `507` on the report channel is a different thing — do not treat the two alike.**
On the image channel it means the user's image storage is full and re-sending changes
nothing. On the report channel it means the old report that should have been evicted
could not be deleted, which does clear by itself, so it is retried like any other
transient failure. Same status code, different channel, opposite handling.

### Citing an image from the web (image block with `source`)

- A cited image is an `image` block carrying `source` — a chart you saw in the
  built-in browser and captured with `browser_capture(tab, ref, report)`
  (`ref` from `browser_snapshot`; `report` = the report's id: `pack.report_id`
  for a pack, else the id you will pass to `write_report`). It saves the
  picture for that report and returns `{file, source}`. When the id already
  has a report, the picture waits for the new one (§1: a report is never
  overwritten) and `write_report` / `publish()` collect it — pass the same id
  to both and never move a picture yourself.
- **Where it goes.** A report built on a pack (a template, `research_pack`, a
  custom recipe): `narrative["images"] = [{"file", "source", "alt"}]` —
  `file` and `source` exactly as returned, `caption` optional. `publish()`
  places the blocks after the data blocks, before the reading, and does not
  count them against R4's 16 blocks. **Never add to `pack.blocks` yourself** —
  `publish()` refuses a pack edited that way. A report you write by hand with
  `write_report`: put `file` and `source` into an `image` block unchanged; do
  not pass the picture through `write_report(images=…)`.
- **A cited image the user asked for always goes in.** A capture that is not
  in the report makes `publish()` refuse until you either cite it or give
  `narrative["images_unused"]` (one sentence saying why); captures left out
  are deleted when the report is written. Whenever the user asked for a cited
  image and the report has none — nothing suitable, every capture refused,
  left out on purpose — the reply says so in one plain sentence.
- `source` is only `{name, url}`
  (the domain is the top-level `host`, not part of `source`). Pages that are
  not `https`, elements near the size of the whole view or larger, and a
  picture that came out blank or cut off (`reason: "incomplete"` — the chart
  had not finished loading; wait and capture again, or pick another) are
  refused (`capture_refused`); nothing is saved. Your own generated figures
  (matplotlib etc.) never carry `source`.
- **At most 2 cited images per report**, and only when the image directly
  supports a claim written in the text. Never decorative. `write_report` (and
  `publish()`, which calls it) refuses a report with more than 2, before
  anything is written.
- **If Blave has the data, draw it yourself** (`candlestick`, `line_chart`,
  `bar_chart`, …) — never cite a screenshot of numbers `lib/data.py` has.
  Cited images are for what Blave cannot produce: on-chain dashboards,
  third-party research figures, exchange-announcement charts.
- `source.url` is the **page URL you read** (`source_url`), never the image
  file URL. `source.name` is the site or publication name (≤40 characters).
  The app's page snapshot is what lets the user check the citation — the URL
  must match the page you actually read. The URL follows the same rules as a
  news link (§3 `news`): `https://`, a host, no user name or password, ≤500
  characters, no spaces — anything else refuses the report.
- **Capture the single chart/figure element only**, cropped to it — never a
  full-page screenshot, never surrounding article text, never browser UI.
  Do not crop out the site's watermark or embedded attribution.
- A page the browser refuses (`blocked_policy`) cannot be captured — use
  another source.
- Reports can be shared publicly with the image and its source line kept:
  capture nothing you would not republish (no personal data, no account UI).
- `alt` says what the chart shows, in the report's language (required; no
  fallback). File rules unchanged (≤2MB); `browser_capture` already crops and
  scales for the 680px column.
- A report with a cited image is `schema_version` `"1.6"`; `write_report` sets it.

## 6. Structural rules worth re-reading before you write

1. `meta` exactly once, first block.
2. `text` with `variant: "lead"` at most once, immediately after `meta`.
3. `footnote` at most once, last block; every `[^id]` resolves to one of its items.
4. `line_chart` carries at most one `primary` series.
5. Every `table` row key is declared in `columns`.
6. `created_at` / `generated_at` / all chart `t` values: unix **seconds**, int, UTC.
7. An unknown block type or an unknown prop refuses the whole report — including a unit
   field on `bar_chart`/`drawdown`, `x_unit` on a `box`, `emphasis_cols` on a `matrix`
   heatmap, `bands` on a `candlestick`, and `w`/`h` on an `image`.
8. In a `number`/`percent` `table` column or `metric_table` item, a loss-shaped figure
   (VaR, Max DD, worst loss) is written with a minus sign — the sign is the only thing the
   colour follows. Conversely, a signed value that is not P&L (`Net Exposure` `+0.62×`)
   is left as `text` so it stays neutral.
9. Every `image` block carries `file` **or** `sha256`, never both; a `file` exists in
   `reports/<id>.files/` and was written before the report JSON.
   `source` (a cited web image) is `{name, url}` only, in a `"1.6"` report, at most 2 per report.
10. A `candlestick` holds 2–120 bars, its `t` strictly increasing, and every bar has
    `low ≤ min(open, close)` and `max(open, close) ≤ high`; it only appears in a report whose
    `schema_version` is `"1.2"` or `"1.3"`.
11. `shareable` and `involves_futures` sit only on `meta`, are `true` or `false` (never a
    string), belong on `type: "research"` only, and only appear in a report whose
    `schema_version` is `"1.3"`.

## 7. Content standards — the report has to say something

Everything above is format. A report can pass all of it — valid blocks, honest numbers,
every measurement basis footnoted — and still be a dashboard printed as prose: each
bullet reading "indicator X moved from A to B, which means C", where C is the same
number said again in words. This section is the bar for what goes **inside** the blocks.

**Scope — read off the envelope `type`.** Not every report carries a view, and forcing
one into a report that shouldn't have it is its own failure.

| `type` | What applies |
|---|---|
| `research`, `morning` | **All six rules.** These exist to answer "what do you think, and why". A hand-written one also follows §7b's presentation rules (A); `research` adds §7b's research rules (B), while a `morning` report keeps §1b's form for levels and conditions. A template brief (§1b) splits the work: the template already carries A3 (a baseline in every caption), A4 (the focus KPI, plus the day's headline in its `title`), A5 (the claim chart first) and A8 (the method footnote) in the blocks it hands you — leave those alone — and you still owe A2 in `lead` and A6 / A7 in `read` / `watch`, in the form §1b defines. |
| `performance` | **Rules 5 and 6 only** (plus rule 2 on any sentence that explains *why* a number moved — stating the number itself is the point of the report and needs no thesis). A performance report is a state snapshot: numbers, attribution, what changed since last time. Do **not** invent an investment view to fill a section; the clean snapshot is the correct output. The runtime produces no report of its own — every performance report is one the user asked for, one-off or as a registered job (§8). §7b does not apply: a snapshot's title names its period, not a thesis. |

### 1. One falsifiable claim, carried by the `lead`

The `text` block with `variant: "lead"` (§3) states **one claim that could have turned out
wrong** — a sentence that would read differently on a different day.

- **Filler:** "Sentiment is neutral-to-bullish; be careful chasing the move." True on almost
  any day. It describes the dashboard instead of reading it.
- **A claim:** "The bid is rotating from spot into leverage, and leverage is not crowded yet —
  the move is still funded by spot demand, not by borrowed positions." A claim is a reading
  of the data, never a call: no buy / sell timing, no price target, no long / short advice
  (§1b, §7b).

The test is whether **a competent reader could disagree with the sentence**. If nobody could,
it is not a claim. Everything else in the report then supports it, qualifies it, or attacks it.

### 2. Every number is a cause or a comparison — the swap test

A figure earns its sentence only by driving a conclusion or by standing against something
(a prior period, a peer, a threshold, an expectation). To check a sentence you just wrote:
**swap the number for a plausibly different value. If the conclusion still stands, the number
was decoration and the sentence is restatement.**

- **Fails:** "Directional alpha is 0.18 against a 7-day mean of 0.12 — neutral-to-bullish, not
  yet euphoric." Put 0.05 in and the same words still get written.
- **Passes:** "Funding is positive across the board but tiny (BTC +0.0085%) — long positioning
  without crowded leverage." At +0.09% the sentence has to say the opposite.

### 3. Answer "so what"

Every section closes on the consequence for the reader: what it changes about the reading,
which condition now matters, which threshold decides the next read. It is never a trade
instruction (no entry, exit or target price, no "add" or "cut exposure"). A paragraph that
ends on the observation is half a paragraph. If you cannot name a consequence, the section is probably not worth a section.

### 4. Write the other side — mandatory

State **what would break the claim**: which indicator, in which direction, past roughly what
level, means the view in the `lead` is wrong and should be dropped. Name the indicator's
threshold, not the mood and not a price to trade at ("if funding goes above ~+0.05% per 8h the crowded-leverage read replaces this one", not
"if leverage gets extreme"). A `callout` with `tone: "warning"` is a good home for it.

This is the rule that adds the most depth, and it only works if you go looking for hostile
evidence **before** you write, not after. **If every figure in the report supports the thesis,
you selected the figures** — go back and pull the ones that argue against it.

### 5. No sentence that is true on any day

"Watch out for a pullback", "keep monitoring", "stay cautious", "the outlook remains
uncertain", "pay close attention to" — these carry no information and cost the reader's trust
in the sentences around them. Delete each one, or replace it with the threshold that would
make it checkable (rule 4).

### 6. Insufficient data is an answer — never manufacture conviction

Rules 1–5 raise the bar for the **argument**, never for how sure you sound. When the data on
hand does not support a judgment, the correct output is to say so — "the data is not sufficient
to judge X" — plus what would be needed to judge it. That is a complete answer and a report may
contain several.

Never invent a mechanism to explain a number you have not verified, never present an inference
as an observation, and never firm up a hedge to make the report read stronger. A confident
sentence with nothing under it is a worse failure than a shallow one: the shallow report wastes
the reader's time, the fabricated one loses them money. Every figure stays real or labelled.

**Two checks on every figure before the report goes out:**

- **A weekly or monthly change is measured from the previous period's last value.** This week's
  融資 change = this Friday's balance − last Friday's, not − this Monday's (a Monday baseline
  turned a +21.1 萬張 week into +5.68 萬張). Name both dates in the footnote. Take that
  baseline from the earlier day's own `margin_balance`, never from `margin_balance_prev`:
  TWSE adjusts 前日餘額 for corporate actions (a 1-for-20 split moved 9/7's by +99,692 張 against
  9/4's actual balance), so mixing the two fields shifts the change. If you do use
  `margin_balance_prev`, say in the report that the change excludes corporate actions.
- **Every percent, annualised or ratio figure agrees with the rest of the report and carries
  the right unit.** A return of 0.0755 is 7.55%, not 0.08%. Cross-check it against a figure you
  already have: a +0.08% annual return cannot sit next to half-year returns that add up to
  about +9.8% a year.

### 7. A change is measured on one basis

Measured on a live report: a 「台積電 ADR 換算溢價」 worked out by hand as ADR 9/23 ÷ 2330's 9/23
close (13.31%) and then ADR 9/25 ÷ 2330's 9/24 close (15.72%), titled 「溢價從 13.31% 擴到
15.72%」. The two sides used a different Taiwan close; on one basis (the 9/24 close) the
earlier value is 14.45% and the change is 1.27 points, not 2.41.

1. **Both values of a before / after comparison use the same basis and the same formula.** The
   denominator, the FX rate and the reference price are each of the same date on both sides.
   When any one of them changed date, the two numbers are not one measure at two moments:
   never write them as 「從 A 到 B」, 「擴大／收斂 N 個百分點」 or a change column.
2. **A figure you derived yourself** (no brick gave it, `describe()` does not list it): the
   table or the caption states the formula and the date of every input. When an input on the
   same basis cannot be had, the cell says 「—」 (the one way a report writes a missing value)
   — do not compute it from what is at hand.
   When the user asked for no estimates (「不要估」), a derived figure stays out of the title
   and the lead.
3. **A percentile is not a rank.** 「第 2 百分位」 is never written as 「第 2 低」, and a rank is
   never written as a percentile.

`quickstart()` and the publish checklist in `describe()` (item 13) carry the same three rules.

## 7b. Hand-written reports — presentation, and the research rules

A report you build yourself with `write_report` — a research write-up, or a `morning` report
the user asked for outside the templates (their own 台股週報, say) — follows two sets of
rules:

| Rules | Apply to |
|---|---|
| **A. Presentation** (A1–A11) | Every hand-written report **except `performance`**, which is a state snapshot whose title names its period, not a thesis (§7 scope table). A template brief (§1b) is only **half** out of scope: its envelope title is fixed by the template (a topic name by design — the list row carries the date, §1b — so A1 is not in play), the template implements A3, A4, A5 and A8 in the blocks it builds, and the narrative you write into it still follows A2, A6 and A7 — §1b says what that looks like in `read` / `watch`. |
| **B. Research rules** (B1–B9) | `type: "research"` only. A hand-written `morning` report keeps §1b's rules instead: levels are statistics, never calls, and its conditions section takes the 觀察重點 (`watch`) form. |

Blocks are flat (§3). A section is a `text` block that opens with its `## ` heading,
followed by the chart / table blocks that back it. Nothing nests inside markdown. Write the
section headings in the report's language.

### A. Presentation — what makes a report worth opening

- **A1. Title = the finding, not the topic**: 「日圓干預只延後了貶值，沒有扭轉它」, not
  「日圓干預分析」. Keep it to **≤ 40 CJK characters / ≤ 80 Latin characters**; a **research
  title is ≤ 24 CJK / ≤ 48 Latin with at most one comma**, and the half a robustness check
  did not support (B4) never goes in it. For research
  the finding is historical, never a forecast (B2). In a morning report the finding is a
  reading of the data (§7 rule 1), never a call: no direction for the days ahead, no
  target, no timing (§1b's levels-are-statistics rule applies to the title too).
  `write_report` copies `title` into
  `meta.title`, so this governs both. *Why:* the title is what the report list and the
  notification show, and for research it heads the public page when the user shares it
  (B), where a title past about 50 CJK characters gets cut; 40 leaves room. A shared research
  link's preview card shows two lines, about 24 CJK, and readers remember the title more than
  the chart, so a wrong title costs more than a wrong chart. A topic name tells a reader
  who sees only the title nothing. The api's 1–200 limit (§2) still stands; this is a
  readability cap, not a format rule.
- **A2. The lead: one falsifiable claim** (§7 rule 1), the `text` block with
  `variant: "lead"` right after `meta`. **In research it names the common belief and what
  the data did to it**: overturned it, discounted it, or confirmed it at a different size.
  Illustrative: 「大家說 iPhone 發表會『賣新聞』——是真的，但只有 2 個百分點」. When you pick
  a research question, prefer one with a popular saying to test. In any other hand-written
  report, write it that way only when the data really answers a popular saying; otherwise
  the lead is the single falsifiable reading of rule 1. Never manufacture a contrast.
  **In research the lead's first sentence** (up to the first 「。」) **is the conclusion itself
  plus one number and its baseline**, ≤ 40 characters, standing on its own — never a
  cliffhanger: 「淨空破紀錄只對了一半」 says neither which half nor by how much. The whole lead
  is ≤ 3 sentences and ≤ 3 numbers, each sentence ≤ 2 numbers plus 1 baseline — §1b R9 S1 /
  N3 in their research form, which adds the number S1 does not ask for.
  *Counting numbers* (here and in A9): percentages, contracts, points, ratios and sample sizes
  count; dates, years, window lengths (「60 日」) and segment numbers do not; a baseline travels
  with the figure it is compared against and is not counted.
  *Why:* the research people open and pass on pairs a contrast with a number anyone can
  compare ("Sell in May", counted against the summers that actually happened). A weekly or
  morning report usually has no myth to break, and a contrast forced onto it drifts toward
  a call. The first sentence is also the share card's description and the notification;
  most shares are never clicked through, so that sentence is all most readers get.
- **A3. Every headline number stands next to its baseline**: random trading days, the
  same-period average, the out-of-sample half, the prior period. Put the baseline in the
  same sentence, in the cell's `delta`, in the chart's `caption` (§3), or as a `benchmark`
  series on the chart. In research the default baseline is every trading day from the first
  event on (the span the events come from); when you use the full-history baseline instead,
  give both side by side. A window that has no baseline on the same basis is not used for a
  conclusion — say so in robustness (B4). *Why:*
  "−2% in the 10 days after a launch" means nothing until the reader sees what an ordinary
  10 days does. This is §7 rule 2's comparison, made visible.
- **A4. `kpi_row` directly after the lead; its first item is the number the claim rests
  on** (the focus cell, §3; the tone rules still apply). In research it is a historical
  statistic, never a current reading or a target price. In a hand-written morning or weekly
  report it is the figure behind the lead (「法人淨賣超 367 億」), not the index level: a
  template brief opens on 加權指數 because the template fixes its KPI row, and yours chooses
  its own. In research: the first item's `label` reads off the page — it names the event
  and the window (「淨空破紀錄後 60 日中位數」, not 「後 60 日中位數」); the baseline goes in its
  `delta` (「平常 +4.3%」「一般交易日 +4.3%」), never in a cell of its own with a `pos` / `neg`
  tone, and that cell's `tone` is `neutral` — the tone colours the delta, so `pos` paints the
  baseline green as if it were a gain; a sample-size cell gives
  segments first, then days (「5 段／47 日」, B9); and when a robustness check did not support
  one half (B4), that half gets a cell. *Why:* it is the first figure a
  reader sees, and a public page and the share card show it as the key number. A context
  figure there, such as a price level or a sample size, advertises a claim it does not support.
- **A5. The first chart block is the one that shows the claim**, not a context chart, and
  it reads on its own as a screenshot: its title states the conclusion (§1b N1), its
  `caption` gives once the sample (segments / days), the period, the baseline and the
  source, and the baseline is drawn on the chart (a `benchmark` series or a `reflines`
  line), not only written in the caption. A context chart never comes before it. A
  price chart is a `candlestick` (§3); anything else uses its native block, and an
  event-window path ("day N after") is a `bar_chart` / `table`, never a `line_chart` on fake
  dates (§3). *Why:* it is
  the first thing a reader looks at, and for research it is the main image of a public
  page; a screenshot passed on carries this chart and its title, nothing else.
- **A6. Key points: one `text` block with 3–5 bullets, each one sentence carrying one
  number** (§7 rule 2, the swap test). *Why:* a reader who stops here should still hold
  the argument.
- **A7. Sections whose `## ` headings are claims** (「## 干預後三次反彈都在 10 個交易日內回吐」,
  not 「## 匯率走勢」), each backed by at least one chart or table block and closed on its
  so-what (§7 rule 3), in a short `text` after the chart or in the chart's `caption`. In
  research the so-what is what the finding does to the claim: how far it generalises and
  where it stops, never a trade and never a reading of today's market. In a morning report
  it is the condition to watch, in the §1b form. *Why:* headings that state the point let
  a reader skim the argument, and a heading with no evidence under it is just an
  assertion.
- **A8. `footnote` last: method and data.** Give the window, frequency, formula and sample
  size, plus the source of every series. *Why:* a report is read later without the chat
  that produced it, so this is where a reader checks how the numbers were made.
- **A9. A number has a home; the prose does not repeat it.** The headline number (the first
  `kpi_row` item) appears at most three times: the KPI cell, the lead and the 「總結」. Every
  other number has one home — a chart or a table; a KPI cell is the index of the chart or
  table it summarises and counts as the same home — and the prose writes it at most once
  more. A robustness table may list the number it tests again, beside its alternative. Key
  points, evidence against and robustness text write only new numbers or new comparisons;
  the 「總結」 says the so-what and where the finding stops. Two different statistics that
  happen to share a value carry their own labels in the same sentence (「事件後 14 日 +2.4%」
  next to 「一般交易日 30 日 +2.4%」 reads as one figure without them). This replaces §1b W1's
  "one place" for hand-written reports, which A2, A4 and B5 already contradict. *Why:* a
  sample research report wrote its headline figure in 7 places and a second one in 9, and
  most of its ~2,000 characters were restatement.
- **A10. One colour, one symbol, one sign, one meaning — and figures agree.** Across the
  whole report a colour, a marker and a sign each carry one meaning (negative = net short in
  every chart and table, never 「正值＝淨空」 in one table; the event and the baseline are
  never the same colour). The sample size is the same everywhere; where it differs (47 event
  days in the KPI, 45 points on a scatter), the block that differs says why. Every figure
  comes from program output, never typed by hand (§1b R1 / R10 check this on a pack; in a
  hand-written report it is on you). *Why:* a screenshot passed on is first attacked on an
  inconsistency, and it costs the rest of the report its credibility.
- **A11. Plain words first, then one word throughout.** A term of art (淨口數, 一般交易日,
  段 in the B9 sense, a Blave indicator) gets a one-sentence plain definition at its first
  appearance in the body, before its number. The title, the lead and the `kpi_row` use
  words a reader already has, and leave the definition to the body. After that, one word
  for one thing: never 「平常」, 「全體」 and 「同期」 for baselines that are, or are not,
  the same. This widens §1b W3 (Blave indicators only) for hand-written reports. *Why:* a
  public page's reader never saw the chat.

### B. Research rules — `type: "research"` only

**How to build one — about four minutes (with an analysis script behind it, 8–12; §1b › *Research questions*), never a hand-written fetch script:**
1. **Search first**, before any code but the data check (§1b › Report flow, § News): 3+ sites,
   read lean (below). A research question runs its data check first (§1b › *Research questions*) —
   that probe decides whether there is a report at all.
2. **`pack = research_pack("SOL", extra=[…], days=30, window="7d")`** (`lib.report_templates`; `days` = the
   span the comparison against BTC covers (not the candle count: 120 bars), `window` = the OI window — `"7d"` unless the question is about today) — price candles and levels,
   volume against its 20-day mean, the coin against BTC, funding / open interest / long-short, Blave
   indicators; a Taiwan stock gets candles, levels and 外資買賣超. `topics=[…]` picks sections
   (`RESEARCH_TOPICS`); `extra` adds up to 3 bricks for what the news is about. Do not read lib
   source or grep for fetchers: `print(pack.describe())` lists every figure you may cite.
3. Write the narrative from `describe()` and the news — `describe()` prints the exact shape: `lead`,
   `read` (the findings), `against` (B3) and `robustness` (B4), both required, `summary` (總結, required)
   and `risk` (B5, what would break it — the summary's last sentence), `news`; no `watch` (B2). The
   claim goes in the title.
4. `publish(pack, narrative, title="<the claim, ≤24 CJK (A1)>", shareable=True|False)` — once; refused →
   fix every listed problem and re-send the same pack by id.
A question the pack cannot answer (a protocol's revenue, a token unlock schedule) is said as such in
the narrative, or cited from a source in the footnote — not fetched by a script you write mid-turn.

Write every research report so it can be shared publicly: the user can make it public from
the workspace (see the top of this page). A public page is read by someone who never saw the
chat, and it leads with the **title**, the **lead**, the **first item of the first
`kpi_row`** and the **first chart**, so A1, A2, A4 and A5 have to carry the claim on their own.

- **B1. Findings, not calls: a hard line.** A research report states findings as historical
  statistics and conditions ("in the last 10 launches the median 10-day return was
  −0.87%"), never as buy / sell timing, a price target or a price level to trade at, or a
  long / short call on a named instrument (a stock, a futures contract, a coin). *Why:* a
  report shared publicly reaches an unspecified public. Under Taiwan's securities and futures
  investment advisory rules, telling that public when or at what price to trade a named
  instrument can amount to running an advisory business without a licence. If the user
  explicitly asks for such a call, write it, but keep it out of the title, the lead and the
  `kpi_row`, and set `shareable` to `false` (B7). If the user then wants to share it, say
  once, in one sentence, that a version without the call is safer to publish, and offer to
  write it; the decision stays theirs.
- **B2. Historical only, never connected to today.** A research report states the
  historical finding and stops there. It does not say the condition is being met now
  ("margin has risen for 8 days in a row"), and it does not project the next N days from
  the publish date. The title states the historical finding, not a forecast. A request
  phrased as a forecast (「融資餘額連續增加後，加權指數接下來會走弱」) is answered as the
  historical question inside it: what followed that condition in the past. *Why:* "after
  margin rose 5 days in a row the index's median 10-day return was −X%" is a statistic;
  add "and margin is rising now" and the same sentence reads as a directional call on the
  index, and so on index futures.
  **A timely topic is fine; reading the present is not.** Studying the history of an event
  in the week it is in the news — a product launch, a central-bank intervention, ex-dividend
  season — is the right time to publish it, and the title still states the historical
  finding. What is out is saying the condition is being met now, or projecting the days
  ahead.
  **No forecasting verbs**: 預告, 預示, 將會, 將持續, 接下來, 中繼, 意味著後市 (English: foreshadows,
  signals ahead, will) — 「它預告的是月線以上的續漲」 published while the condition is on
  reads as a call on the index whatever the data says. **An unfinished window**: when the last
  event's forward window runs past the publish date, that event (or segment, B9) is marked
  「觀察期未滿、不計」, left out of every statistic, and appears only in a table and the
  footnote; the prose does not comment on it.

  B1 and B2 win over §7 wherever they meet (§7's examples read today's market, which fits
  a morning brief, not a research report), and they govern B3–B6.
- **B3. Evidence against: a mandatory section** (「哪些數據不支持這個結論」). List the
  figures that do not fit the claim, each with its number and what it does to the claim's
  strength. If you found none, list what you checked. *Why:* §7 rule 4 — if every figure
  supports the thesis, you selected the figures.
- **B4. Robustness: a mandatory section with at least one check**
  (「換個做法結論還站得住嗎」):
  - *Different window or baseline*: the same measurement on another lookback, start date
    or benchmark.
  - *Split sample*: first half vs second half, or before vs after a named event. A result
    that shows up in one half only is a regime, not a rule. Each half is measured against
    the **same-period** baseline: it passes only when both halves' "event minus same-period
    baseline" have the same sign — two positive raw returns do not count (+1.5% after the
    events against +10.9% on every day of the same years is the effect reversed, not
    confirmed).
  - *Placebo*: the same method on randomly drawn dates (or a matched unrelated series);
    the real effect has to stand clear of that distribution. State the number of draws and
    report it as "beats N of M random dates". It is not MCPT, so never label it a p-value
    from MCPT (AGENTS.md › MCPT).
  - *Another source or another definition*: re-measure the same claim from a second data
    source, or with a second way of computing the figure (another smoothing, another
    bucketing of the same raw series). Only a same-direction result counts as a pass.
    Most series here have one source only — when there is no second one, say in the
    report that the finding rests on a single source, rather than skipping the check
    silently.
  - *Strategy research*: cite what the strategy already has — `"MCPT p-value"` in
    `strategies/<name>/stats.json` (automatic on every Type A backtest; rerun with
    `lib.validation.mcpt` only for a different `n`), peak vs plateau from `scan.json`
    (`lib.param_scan`: `scan_grid → find_plateau → write_scan`), and out-of-sample Sharpe
    and WFE from `wf.json` (`lib.walk_forward.run_walk_forward`). Details are in
    `references/lib.md`. Running a new scan or walk-forward for a report counts as an
    iteration under the Iteration Brakes, so ask first. The report may state that a check
    was not run.

  When a check does not support the claim, report it as it came out and weaken the lead
  and the title to match (A1, A4). Never swap in a check that passes. *Why:* a claim that holds on
  one window only is the most common way a research report is wrong, and this is the
  section that catches it.
- **B5. What would break this: the last sentence of the 「總結」** (`risk`; `publish` appends it to
  `summary`). Name the evidence that would falsify the historical finding, with a
  threshold (§7 rule 4): for example "the next 3 launches show a median 10-day return above
  0%", or "the effect disappears once 2020–2021 is excluded". Never name a current market
  level to watch, and never a price to enter, exit or target. *Why:* it tells the reader
  how the finding could fail without turning it into a live signal.
- **B6. Length.** Aim for **≥ 4 chart / table blocks** and enough prose to carry every
  section. This is not a word count. A section the data cannot fill says "the data is not
  sufficient to judge X" plus what would settle it (§7 rule 6). That is a complete section;
  padding is not.
- **B7. `meta.shareable`: your self-check record on every research report.** A boolean on the
  `meta` block (`write_report(..., meta={"shareable": ...})`) recording whether the report,
  as written, meets the research rules in full. It is a record, not a gate: the workspace
  and the platform do not read it, and a `false` report can still be shared by the user.
  Never name the field to the user, and never tell them a report cannot be shared because of
  it. Set it on purpose every time.
  - **`true`** only when all of these hold: B1 and B2 hold everywhere in the report, not
    only in the title, the lead and the `kpi_row`, with no forecasting verb and any unfinished
    window left out (B2); B3–B5, B8 and B9 are all there; and it cites,
    backtests or describes no strategy sold in the Marketplace (`references/marketplace.md`
    › *Strategy categories*), whether the user bought it or sells it.
  - **`false`, always**, when any of these is true: it gives buy / sell timing, a price
    target, an entry, exit, support or resistance level, or a long / short call on a named
    instrument — including one the user explicitly asked for (B1's exception); it says a
    condition is being met now or projects from today (B2); it cites a Marketplace strategy
    as above (official, shared-with-me and unlisted private strategies do not count); or any
    of B1–B5, B8 or B9 is missing. When unsure, `false`.
  - `research` only. Leave it off `morning` and `performance`.
  - The flag records the report; it never changes what you write. B1–B6, B8 and B9 apply to every
    research report whatever the flag says, and you do not drop what the user asked for to
    earn a `true`.
  - It needs `schema_version` `"1.3"` (§2); `write_report` sets that.

  *Why:* a shared research report is read by people outside the chat, and writing the flag
  down forces an explicit check against B1–B5 each time. A report that names a trade, reads
  today's market or promotes a paid strategy whose seller earns a share of each sale must
  never be recorded as `true`.

- **B8. A median or an average never travels alone.** Wherever one carries the finding —
  the title, the lead, a `kpi_row` item, a section's claim — the same sentence or the same
  block gives the spread behind it: the hit rate ("6 of the 10"), the worst single case, or
  the distribution itself (`histogram` / `box`, §3). Name the sample size every time; a
  central tendency over a handful of events is one more reason the reader needs the spread,
  not a reason to leave it out. *Why:* "the median 10-day return over the last 10 launches
  was −0.87%" and "6 of those 10 were positive" describe the same ten events, and a reader
  given only the first takes a coin flip for a rule. A3 puts a figure next to its baseline;
  this puts it next to its own dispersion — the more common way a true number misleads.

- **B9. Overlapping events are one segment, not many samples.** When the gap between two
  events is shorter than the forward window, they belong to one segment; a new segment starts
  only after a gap longer than the window. Compute the main statistic again at the segment
  level and write it as 「N 段裡幾段贏過基準」 (an unfinished segment is not counted, B2). When
  one segment holds more than a third of the event days, the lead or the evidence against
  (B3) says so. *Why:* 23 of a sample report's 47 event days fell in one stretch
  (2020-12 to 2021-05); with a 60-day window they are the same rally counted 23 times.

**Order in a research report:** `meta` → lead (A2) → `kpi_row` (A4) → first chart (A5) →
key points (A6) → 3–5 argument sections (A7) → evidence against (B3) → robustness (B4) →
what would break this (B5) → `footnote` (A8).

For a `research` report only, `write_report` prints a `WARNING:` (it never refuses) when
the title is over the A1 research cap (24 CJK / 48 Latin), when the lead's first sentence is
over 40 CJK / 80 Latin or has no digit (A2), when the lead is not followed by a `kpi_row`, or when
`meta.shareable` is missing (B7; a reminder to record it, not a sharing gate). Everything else here is yours to check, in research and in
a hand-written morning report alike.

## 8. Scheduled reports — a job directory, not a cron line

A recurring report is **one directory plus one registration file**. You write the script and
the registration; the runtime owns the schedule (it reads the registration and fires the script
itself — nothing is ever installed in crontab or a scheduled task), records every run and
reports the list to the web, where the user can pause, resume, run now and delete without you.
**Never touch crontab or schtasks for a report.** `lib.report.register_schedule` writes both
files correctly:

```python
from lib.report import register_schedule, list_schedules, remove_schedule, set_timezone

register_schedule(
    "perf-4h",                                   # id: [a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,39}, a slug
    "每 4 小時運行狀況",                          # title, 1–80
    "每 4 小時給我一份各策略運行狀況：倉位、當日損益、最近訊號、有沒有錯誤。",  # the user's words, verbatim
    "0 */4 * * *",                               # cron, 5 fields, in the USER's wall-clock time
    "每 4 小時",                                  # the schedule in words — the only form the user sees
    script,                                      # full text of run.py
)
list_schedules()        # every job + its last run — for 「我有哪些定期報告」
remove_schedule("perf-4h")   # when the user asks you in chat to delete one
```

```
workspace/report_jobs/<id>/
  job.json      the registration — exists = registered, deleted = cancelled
  run.py        your script (a custom recipe's is the fixed `RECIPE_RUN_PY`)
  recipe.json   a custom recipe's bricks (`save_recipe`, §1b › Custom recipes); none for other jobs
  runs.jsonl    written by the runtime: one line per run, read-only for you
  run.log       stdout + stderr of the last run, read-only for you
```

`job.json` (what `register_schedule` writes; the file is the contract, the helper is a
convenience):

```json
{"id": "perf-4h", "title": "每 4 小時運行狀況",
 "prompt": "每 4 小時給我一份各策略運行狀況：倉位、當日損益、最近訊號、有沒有錯誤。",
 "schedule": {"human": "每 4 小時", "cron": "0 */4 * * *", "tz": "Asia/Taipei"},
 "enabled": true, "created_at": 1756800000, "updated_at": 1756800000, "pending": null}
```

- Same id again = update. `register_schedule` keeps `created_at`, bumps `updated_at` and
  sets `pending` back to `null` — that is how the web learns an edit has landed, so always
  re-register through it rather than editing the file by hand. At most 20 jobs per machine.
- **Changing or deleting an existing job on your own initiative waits for the user's yes.**
  When you decide to re-register a job with a different cron, edit its `run.py`, change the
  report id it writes, or remove it — a bug fix, a side edit, or re-registering over an
  existing job while handling a differently worded request — tell the user what changes,
  before → after in their own wall-clock time (「tw-weekly:每週五 21:52 → 每週五 13:52」),
  and do it only once they confirm. A fix you are sure of is proposed the same way,
  never applied on the side. A user instruction that names the change (「把 tw-weekly 刪掉」,
  「tw-weekly 改成 22:00」) or the web's edit flow (end of this section) is its own
  confirmation: do it and state the before → after in the reply.
- **A hand-written report never reuses a job's report id** (`tw-weekly-20260911`): it would
  be filed as one more run of that job. Give it its own (`tw-weekly-narr-20260911`).
- `prompt` is the user's own request, not your rewrite; the web shows it back as the
  report's description and hands it to you again when they edit it.
- `schedule.cron` is standard 5-field cron — no `@daily`, no seconds field, no month/weekday
  names. The web never displays the cron; it displays `schedule.human` and the next run time
  the runtime computes from the cron, which is how a mis-parse becomes visible — so restate
  the schedule when you register it (AGENTS.md).
- **Time zone: write the user's wall-clock time, unconverted.** 台北 08:30 is `30 8 * * *`,
  台北週一 05:00 is `0 5 * * 1` — nothing else. The zone the runtime reads that cron in is
  `schedule.tz`, which `register_schedule` fills from the machine's own setting
  (`state/timezone`, written by the platform from the user's browser), and it handles daylight
  saving on its own. **Never convert to the machine's clock and never compute an offset
  yourself**: the runtime would then apply the zone on top of your conversion and the report
  would run at the wrong time twice over. `schedule.human` is the same wall-clock time in
  words (「每週五 21:52」). If `register_schedule` raises because the machine has no time zone
  on record, ask the user which time zone they are in, record it with
  `set_timezone("Asia/Taipei")`, then register — never guess it and never substitute this
  machine's clock. (The platform's own write keeps whatever you set, so you only do this once.)
- **Say in the restatement what a run costs** (R8, cloud): each run wakes you once, on whatever
  model the user is on at the time, and costs about `scheduled_cost()` points; over the 1.0 USD cap,
  or without credit, that run is data only. Register with `agent_consent=True` only on their yes.
  On the desktop or a trial / one-slot machine (`scheduled_agent_available()` False), say the
  scheduled version is data only.
- **Linux and Windows run the same expression.** There is no scheduled-task subset to work
  around: 每週一至週五 08:30 is one job, `30 8 * * 1-5`, on either platform.

### Scheduled agent runs

**Cloud machines only, and only for a job registered with `agent_consent=True`** (R8). On the
desktop, and for any other job, a scheduled run is the data-only `run.py`, as before. When such a
job comes due, the runtime starts **one unattended turn** with the user's own request and this
job's id. Nobody is watching it:

- Build the pack the job's `run.py` (or its `recipe.json`) builds, read `describe()`, search the
  news (§1b › News), write the narrative, and call `publish(pack, narrative)` **once**. Same rules
  as chat: R1–R10, no advice, tags display only.
- Ask nothing — no one will answer. A page, a login or a step that needs the user is skipped.
- Touch nothing else: no edits to `report_jobs/`, `strategies/`, `control/`, `lib/` or `.env`, no
  schedule changes, never an order. This is a rule you keep, not a wall: the Edit / Write tools
  refuse those paths, Bash does not.
- The turn has a 1.0 USD budget, 25 steps and 10 minutes. If it runs out, or the credit does,
  the runtime publishes the job's data-only `run.py` output with one footnote line saying why;
  three such runs in a row notify the user. The agent runs at most once per job per day; a
  「立即執行」 after that is data only — a failed attempt counts too. Running out of credit is
  said in the footnote only, never notified.
- It runs on the user's model preference **at the time of the run**, not the one at registration.
- Re-registering a job (an edit) keeps its `agent_consent` unless you pass `agent_consent=False`.
  The consent is only as good as your word: nothing checks the user really said yes, so never set
  it without that yes (R8).
- A trial or one-slot machine never runs the agent for a schedule: its only turn slot stays the
  user's. Those runs are data only, with no footnote. After an upgrade the next scheduled report of
  each job without consent says once, in the footnote, that the user can ask you to turn it on —
  nothing turns on by itself: ask R8's question and re-register with `agent_consent=True` on a yes.
- On the desktop the app must be open for any scheduled run: a run that came due while it was
  closed is recorded as skipped, not made up later.

`run.py` constraints — it runs exactly like a scheduled strategy:

- cwd is the workspace, but the runtime starts it as `python3 report_jobs/<id>/run.py`, so
  Python puts `report_jobs/<id>/` on `sys.path`, not the workspace: pin the workspace before
  any `from lib…` (`sys.path.insert(0, os.getcwd())`, §1b). Try it once the same way:
  `python3 report_jobs/<id>/run.py` from the workspace root.
- Every `BLAVE_*` environment variable is stripped: no machine token, no direct API call to
  the platform. On the desktop exactly three pass — `BLAVE_AGENT_LOCAL=1` and
  `BLAVE_SCHEDULED_RUN=1` (the key-free TAIEX series and reading "no Blave access" from `.env`)
  and `BLAVE_KLINE_SOURCE` (crypto klines from Binance, as in a chat turn) — plus the desktop
  path variables (`BLAVE_AGENT_BASE` / `_WORKSPACE` / `_HOME` / `_STATE`) when set. When it runs as the
  fallback of a failed agent turn, `BLAVE_REPORT_DEGRADED` carries the reason, and only a template
  `publish(pack)` turns it into the footnote line. A report reaches the platform only by landing in `reports/` —
  `write_report(...)` or a template `publish(pack)` (§1b), with pictures in the sidecar (§5).
- Write nothing when there is nothing to report. Exit 0 with no new `reports/*.json` is
  recorded as `skipped`, which is the correct outcome for a signal-only job; a non-zero
  exit or a run over 600 s is `failed` (the tail of `run.log` shows in the web, and the
  usual failure alert fires). Do not script a fixed judgement into it — `run.py` is the
  data-only form (§1b); the narration, where there is one, comes from the scheduled agent turn above.
- Use date-stamped report ids (`perf-20260902-0800`). Every run is kept: a run that lands
  on an id already used is written as `-2`, `-3`, … (§1), never over the earlier one.

When the user edits a job from the web you receive 「請修改定期報告「{title}」（id：{id}）。
新的描述：「…」。新的週期：「…」…」: change `run.py` and/or the schedule accordingly, call
`register_schedule` again with the same id, and restate the parsed schedule. Finish it in
that turn — the web shows a waiting state until the re-registration lands.
