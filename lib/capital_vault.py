"""Where 群益's 身分證字號 + trading password actually live on a cloud box.

The runtime's `credentials` command (runtime/capital_connect.divert_credentials)
writes them to <base>/credentials/capital_vault.json — owned by and readable
only by Administrator, the identity the worker and the capital reconciler run
as — and leaves sentinels in .env (`capital_api_key=` empty,
`capital_password=vault:<fingerprint>`) so venue discovery keeps working. It is
a separate file for the 群益 order code only — out of .env, so strategies and
the agent do not pick it up in passing (SYSTEM could still take it on purpose).

Imported two ways: capital_worker.py runs as a bare script with lib/ on
sys.path (`import capital_vault`), order_capital.py as `lib.capital_vault`.
Keep it free of other lib imports.
