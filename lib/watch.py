"""
Watchboard helper — add / update / remove widgets on the user's board and feed
the machine widgets, all by dropping files in `workspace/watch/`.

The board lives on the platform; this machine only writes files. An *op* file in
`watch/ops/` asks the platform to add, update or remove a widget; a *data* file
in `watch/data/<widget_id>.json` carries the current content of one machine
widget (one report block). **The write is the finish line:** the runtime's
uploader ships each file and moves ops to `ops/sent/` or `ops/failed/` (with a
line in `watch/upload_errors.log`); data files are overwritten in place on every
refresh. Never wait for the upload before saying the widget is created.

This module is a convenience only — the drop directory is the contract, so a file
written with `json.dump` into that path works exactly the same. What it saves
you: the atomic writes, the envelope boilerplate, the catalogue / size / cron /
symbol checks (so a bad widget fails here with a message instead of in
`ops/failed/` minutes later), and, for machine widgets, the `report_jobs/<id>/`
registration the runtime schedules from.

Catalogue, limits and the script template: `references/watchboard.md`.

Usage:
    from lib.watch import add_widget, update_widget, remove_widget, write_data, status

    add_widget("txf", "price", "台指期", symbol="TXF")                  # stream widget
    add_widget("tsmc-k", "kline", "2330 1 分 K", symbol="2330", interval="1m")
    add_widget("btc-1h", "kline", "BTC 1H", symbol="BTC", venue="binance", interval="60m")  # crypto
    add_widget("tsmc-k5", "kline", "台積電 5 分 K", symbol="2330", interval="5m",      # price levels
               levels=[{"price": 2300, "side": "below"}, {"price": 2450, "side": "above", "label": "前高"}])
    update_widget("tsmc-k5", levels=[{"price": 2280, "side": "below"}])   # reset the monitor
    add_widget("btc-k", "kline", "BTC 1 小時 K", symbol="BTC", venue="binance",  # indicator pane
               interval="60m", panes=[{"id": "holder_concentration"}])   # id = the slug
    update_widget("btc-k", panes=[])                       # drop the pane, keep the chart
    add_widget("txf-exec", "strategy_chart", "txf_composite_60m · 進出場",   # a strategy's chart
               strategy="txf_composite_60m")
    add_widget("risk", "block", "持倉風險",                              # machine widget
               block_type="kpi_row", refresh_cron="*/5 * * * *",
               refresh_human="每 5 分鐘", script=script_text)
    update_widget("risk", title="持倉風險(實盤)")
    remove_widget("risk")

Inside a machine widget's `run.py` (scheduled by the runtime, no LLM, no token):
    from lib.watch import write_data
    write_data("risk", {"type": "kpi_row", "items": [...]})

Diagnosis only — never the next step after a write:
    status("risk")                     # newest op for that widget: pending | sent | failed: … | unknown
    status("1725256325123-add.json")   # one op file by name

    type          `price` / `kline` / `book` / `watchlist` (stream), `strategy_chart`
                  (one of your strategies' entry/exit chart) or `block` (machine).
    title         1–40 chars, the tile header.
    symbol        stream, all but watchlist: a stock id (4–8 letters/digits), `TAIEX`,
                  `TXF` or `MXF`; `book` accepts only `TXF` / `MXF` (or a crypto
                  perpetual with venue="binance"). With venue="binance"
                  a Binance USD-M perpetual — `BTC`, `BTCUSDT` or `BTC/USDT` — written
                  as given, uppercased, `/` and `-` removed; the api normalises the rest.
    symbols       watchlist: 1–20 symbols (same shapes as `symbol`; Taiwan only).
    interval      kline: `1m` / `5m` / `15m` / `60m` / `1d`.
    levels        kline only (Taiwan or crypto): price monitor lines drawn on the chart,
                  0–4 of `{"price": 2300, "side": "below"}` / `{"price": 2450, "side":
                  "above", "label": "前高"}`. `side` is the crossing direction (above =
                  breakout, below = breakdown); `label` ≤ 12 chars replaces the direction
                  word. Stamped with `since` = now here — never pass it. The web derives
                  "triggered" from the bars after `since` (one-shot: stays triggered until
                  you `update_widget(levels=...)`). No script, second-level, zero cost.
    panes         kline with venue="binance" only (the indicator library is a crypto one —
                  a Taiwan kline is refused here): 0–2 indicator sub-panes drawn under the
                  candles, `[{"id": "holder_concentration"}]`. `id` is the indicator's **slug**
                  — the same word `lib/data.py` fetches it with, so its alpha fetchers are the
                  list to pick from. This machine cannot check the slug exists, so an unknown
                  one (or an indicator that is not a line) comes back as an api 400. No script,
                  no job, no cron — the platform fetches the indicator, so never build this as
                  a `block` + `line_chart` computed by a script.
    venue         price / kline / book only: `"binance"` makes `symbol` a crypto symbol (contract
                  §3.1; refused on book / watchlist / block). A crypto K-line is always
                  this widget, never a block + line_chart drawn by a script — the live
                  candles come from the platform stream.
    strategy      strategy_chart only: the name of one of this machine's strategies,
                  and it must have trades in its backtest. The card is the strategy tab's
                  進出場點位 chart — candles, entry/exit arrows, position lines and the
                  live price. Everything else about it is the strategy's own: **never
                  pass symbol / interval / venue / block_type or a script** (refused
                  here), and there is no `props` to set — the period is the one the
                  strategy was back-tested on. The platform serves the data from the
                  strategy it already holds; this machine sends nothing and runs no job.
    block_type    machine: the report block the script will send (see BLOCK_TYPES).
    refresh_cron  machine: 5-field cron in the USER's wall-clock time (the zone comes from
                  the machine's own setting, `state/timezone` — never convert it yourself);
                  `*/1 * * * *` is the densest schedule there is — no seconds field. Only
                  the grammar is checked here. Linux and Windows run the same expression.
    refresh_human machine: the schedule in words (「每 5 分鐘」), the only form the
                  user sees, so it must match the cron.
    script        machine: the full text of `report_jobs/<id>/run.py`. It runs like a
                  scheduled strategy (cwd = workspace, no `BLAVE_*`, no token, no LLM)
                  and publishes by calling `write_data(id, block)`.
    w, h          initial size in grid units; omit them for the type's default (price 4×2,
                  kline 6×3 — 6×4 with one indicator pane, 6×5 with two; book 3×3;
                  watchlist 4×3; strategy_chart 8×6; a block goes by its block_type,
                  6×3 for a chart-like one).
                  The minimum is a floor, not the default, and a size you pass is taken as
                  given. Position is the user's — the platform appends the tile to the
                  bottom row.

    kline), refresh schedule or (machine only) script. Returns the op file path, or None
    when only the script changed (that is local — the runtime picks the new run.py up on
    its next run, no op needed).

    Never the position or size: `grid` belongs to the user's drag-and-drop and an
    update op does not carry it. `props` is a dict of the type's props (`interval` for
    kline, `block_type` for block); for a machine widget the local `report_jobs/<id>/`
    registration is rewritten to match, through the same `register_schedule` path.

    `levels` (kline only, contract §3.4): `None` leaves the monitor alone, `[]` clears
    it, a new list **resets** it — every entry gets a fresh `since`, so the web's
    triggered state goes back to "watching". Same shape as in `add_widget`; `since` is
    never yours to pass.

    `panes` (crypto kline only, contract §3.5): `None` leaves the indicator sub-panes
    alone, `[]` removes them and keeps the chart, a list of 0–2 `{"id": "<slug>"}` replaces
    them. Same shape as in `add_widget`. The card is not resized — `grid` is the user's —
    so on a 6×3 card the panes are tight; say so and let the user drag it taller (a card
    with one pane is comfortable at 6×4, two at 6×5).

    `props`, `levels` and `panes` are a shallow merge on the api (contract §4.1): only the
    keys sent change, the rest of the widget's props stay. Whether the widget is a kline —
    and, for `panes`, whether it is a *crypto* kline — is not checked here: a stream widget
    leaves no record on this machine. Sending either to the wrong widget is refused by the
    api (400, `status` shows `failed` naming it).

    A `strategy_chart` takes **`title` only**: it has no props, and its source is the
    strategy (a different strategy is a different card). Anything else is refused by the
    api. To point the card at another strategy, remove it and add the new one.

    Changing a block's `block_type` to a chart-like one (CHART_BLOCKS, minimum 4×3) is
    not size-checked here — this machine has no view of the board. If the tile is
    currently smaller the api refuses the op (400, shows as `failed`); ask the user to
    resize the tile first, then send the update again.
