"""
Trading guard: filesystem kill switch + append-only order audit log.

Why this exists: every safety rule in AGENTS.md (verify-then-report,
iteration brakes) runs through the model following instructions. This is the
one brake that does NOT: if the file state/HALT exists, no new-exposure order
leaves this machine, regardless of what the agent believes it is doing.
lib/order_*.py enforces it inside the transport layer, so every path that
uses the lib — strategies, reconciler, TWAP slices, ad-hoc scripts — is
covered without any caller opting in.

HALT semantics — blocks NEW EXPOSURE only:
- Blocked while halted: entry orders (anything that opens or adds to a
  position).
- Still allowed: reduce-only closes, protective SL/TP orders, cancels.
  A kill switch that traps a losing position is worse than none — flattening
  must always work under halt.
- The file's EXISTENCE is authoritative. Its JSON content ({ts, reason,
  source}) is attribution only — a malformed or hand-touched HALT file still
  halts (fail-closed).

Who trips it: the user (e.g. "全部停止" → agent runs trip_halt), a monitor
like manager/healthcheck.py on anomalies, or anyone creating state/HALT by
hand. Clearing requires an explicit user instruction — the agent must NEVER
clear a halt on its own initiative.

Audit log: state/audit.jsonl — one JSON line per order attempt, outcome,
halt denial, and halt change, fsynced per line so it survives a crash.
audit() never raises: a protective order must not fail because the audit
disk write did (errors are logged and swallowed — the one sanctioned
exception to the no-silent-failure rule, and only for the LOG write).

# it names. Each order lib's place_market_order offers its own order
# (arm_restore) before sending; entry_blocked() lets through only an armed
# pass, and spends it. Audited. The machine-restart stop still blocks it:
