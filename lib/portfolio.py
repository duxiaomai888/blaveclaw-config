# then reads that manual position as "already have it" and trades against it
# (adds to it, or closes it down to target). self_ledger fixes this not by
# reading the account differently, but by not reading it AT ALL for diffing:
# the bot instead tracks what IT has bought/sold from its own order log
# (manager/orders.jsonl, already written by _append_reconciler_log below) and
# diffs target against that running total. A position opened outside this
# process is invisible to the ledger by construction, so it can never be
# absorbed. Trade-off (see references/manager.md § self_ledger): the ledger can
# drift from the real account (missed fills, manual trades on the same symbol)
# — this only fixes "bot ignores what it doesn't own", not "bot always knows
# the true account state"; margin/liquidation checks still need the real
# get_positions_fn() read, never the ledger.
