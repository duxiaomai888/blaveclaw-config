# ── self-ledger (bot's own tracked position, decoupled from the exchange's
#    raw account read — see portfolio_config.json["self_ledger"]) ──────────
# Root problem: get_positions_fn() reads the ACCOUNT's real position, which on
# a single-account setup includes whatever the user opened by hand — reconcile()
# then reads that manual position as "already have it" and trades against it
# (adds to it, or closes it down to target). self_ledger fixes this not by
# reading the account differently, but by not reading it AT ALL for diffing:
# the bot instead tracks what IT has bought/sold from its own order log
# (manager/orders.jsonl, already written by _append_reconciler_log below) and
# diffs target against that running total. A position opened outside this
# process is invisible to the ledger by construction, so it can never be
# absorbed. Trade-off (see references/manager.md § self_ledger): the ledger can
# drift from the real account (missed fills, manual trades on the same symbol)
# — this only fixes "bot ignores what it doesn't own", not "bot always knows
# the true account state"; margin/liquidation checks still need the real
# get_positions_fn() read, never the ledger.
#
# UNIT OF THE BOOK — two numbers per symbol, never one. `cost` (signed USD:
# what the fills were worth WHEN THEY HAPPENED) answers "should I trade":
# target is diffed against it, so a held position never moves with the mark
# (Wei 2026-09-21: fixed quantity — what was bought is held until the signal
# changes). `qty` (signed base units the bot bought) answers "how much": a
# reduce leg sells qty × |diff| ÷ |cost|, a close sells the whole qty. The
# book used to be `cost` alone, and a close converted it back at the CURRENT
# mark — measured 2026-09-21 on paper: closing 20% above entry stranded 16.7%
# of the position, closing 20% below left a phantom long that re-sent a dead
# reduce leg every round, and with a manual holding in the same symbol it
# sold the USER's coins (the cap was the whole account, not the bot's share).

    Such a machine has been reading the WHOLE account as its own, so its bot
    and manual positions are mixed. The bot's share of each symbol is taken as
    min(|account|, |target|) when the two are on the SAME side (Wei 2026-09-23)
    — the most a strategy can own of what is there — and the rest is the
    user's. Everything else is the user's: a symbol no funded strategy trades
    (a removed strategy's leftover included), a flat target, and an account on
    the other side of its target (a short under a long target: the bot owns 0
    and buys its target from there). Nothing in this rule ever sells: the
    adopted cost is never above the target.

    How much of the quantity (Wei 2026-09-23): up to _ADOPT_WHOLE_RATIO × the
    target's notional, the WHOLE account quantity is the bot's (a profitable
    bot position is worth more than its target; splitting it would leave the
    bot's own last lot to the user). Above that, the target's share, floored to
    the venue step in base units (_venue_quantize); the rest is the user's. A
    venue that reports no quantity (a dict-contract lib) gets a legacy row.

    The decision is permanent, so it waits for inputs it can trust: the
    portfolio is configured, every funded strategy's state is readable, every
    quantity read succeeds, and two rounds in a row saw the same positions (an
    empty or short answer from the venue would make the bot's own positions the
    user's for good). TWAP / chase in flight waits too — seeding now would
    double-count their fills.

    fallback=True (reconcile, after _baseline_stuck): a wait that would never
    end is not waited out — a read-only machine sends no exit either. Every

    SOLD (average cost — not by what the sale fetched, which is where the old

    with and the update itself never trades; its qty is `executed_qty` signed
    like `signed_diff` — the exchange-confirmed fill, a record, not a guess.

    LEGACY row = a position whose quantity cannot be known: a non-zero seed
    row without `qty` (seed_ledger --absorb from an older build), a fill with
    no `executed_qty` (hand-written place_order returning None), or a replay

    flat or reconcile closes it and writes it off; from there it is a quantity
    row like any other.

    == "futures_contracts" — lots, e.g. capital/TW futures — or "shares"; see
    native_units / strategy_amounts): diffs there are single/low-double-digit
    lots, so a currency threshold of 10 would silently swallow every order,
    including a close-on-removal (target absent, asset_spec None — checked via
    `exchange` too). Those rows skip `threshold` entirely; their own
    place_order_fn applies the real minimum (e.g. reconciler.py's
    _capital_place_order round-half-up gate).

    `drift_band` is an optional callable(symbol) -> fraction (module-level
    drift_band; reconcile passes it in account-read mode only). A same-side
    notional row is then also gated at that fraction of |target|: the mark
    moving `actual` is not a position gap. Never applied to a row whose target
    is flat or on the other side (a whole-position close), nor to a
    native-unit row. None = today's gates alone (hand-written callers).

    `gates` is an optional OUT dict (return value unchanged — hand-written
    callers exist): a row with either side above the flat threshold is recorded
    as {symbol: {'usd': gate this round, 'diff': signed_diff,
    'entry_usd': .., 'reduce_usd': .., 'close_usd': ..[, 'side': 'reduce'][, 'band_usd': ..]}},
    placed or not, so
    the workspace can show the number instead of leaving "diff 22, no order, no
    error" unexplained. `usd`/`diff`/`side` are the shipped shape and do not
    move; BOTH sides are carried because the live diff a reader colours can
    have flipped sign since this round — with one side only it would colour a
    buy against the reduce gate. `band_usd` (the drift band valued at the
    target) is present only on a row it applied to; `usd` already includes it.
    Flat-gate rows are left out on both sides — there is nothing to explain there.

    Full reconciliation cycle:
      1. aggregate_portfolio() → target (weighted positions × account value, in account currency)
      2. get_positions_fn()    → actual exchange positions (in account currency)
      3. compute_diff()        → place orders

    place_order_fn(symbol, signed_diff, asset_spec, reduce_only=False):
      signed_diff > 0 → buy  (increase long / reduce short)
      signed_diff < 0 → sell (increase short / reduce long)
      reduce_only=True → close-only leg of a position flip; pass to exchange reduce-only flag.
      asset_spec: dict from portfolio_config["asset_specs"], or None for default (fractional qty, no lot constraint).
        Use it to convert signed_diff → native qty/contracts/lots.

    Position flips (long→short or short→long) are split into two calls:
      1. place_order_fn(symbol, -actual, asset_spec, reduce_only=True)   ← close existing
      2. place_order_fn(symbol, target,  asset_spec, reduce_only=False)  ← open new
    This prevents simultaneous long+short on hedge-mode exchanges (OKX 兩倉模式, etc.).
    If place_order_fn does not accept reduce_only, the kwarg is silently dropped.

    Kill switch: while state/HALT exists, legs that ADD exposure are denied here
    (audited to state/audit.jsonl) before place_order_fn is called. Legs that
    reduce or close a position always go through — see lib/guard.py.

    Returns the orders that got AT LEAST ONE confirmed fill this round — not
    every order attempted. Callers use truthiness to schedule an immediate
    convergence re-run (force_next); returning failed orders too would turn a
    persistent failure (bad key, insufficient margin) into a poll-interval
    retry storm — failures instead wait for the next state change / heartbeat.
