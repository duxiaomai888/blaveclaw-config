# Account library for President Futures (統一期貨) — domestic futures account.
#
# Never talks to the broker: lib/president_worker.py holds the machine's one
# long-lived Unitrade login and writes state/president_account.json; this
# module reads that snapshot, so the platform readers never log in (and never
# hold the trading or certificate password).
#
# No get_flows: Unitrade has no deposit/withdrawal query (API/daccount lists
# margin, positions, unliquidated, combine, net — nothing else), so the
# platform falls back to flagging equity jumps as 資金異動, as it does for 群益.
# See references/president-broker.md.
