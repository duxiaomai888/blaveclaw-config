"""Which venues break the crypto auto-wire contract, and how.

Every branch in manager/, lib/ and runtime/ that behaves differently for a
Taiwan broker asks this table instead of comparing a venue id string, so
wiring in another broker is one row here plus its own libs — not a hunt
through the reconciler, flatten and the runtime for `== "capital"`.
tests/check_venue_traits.py fails on a bare venue-id literal outside this
file, the venue's own libs, and runtime/venue_traits.py (a verbatim copy:
the runtime ships on its own channel and may sit on an older workspace).

A missing trait means the crypto default (auto-wired, perp, sized in
account currency). Trait meanings:
  auto_wire          False: lib.venue_wiring never routes it (signed-diff
                     contract; the reconciler or nothing handles it)
  hand_wired         manager/reconciler.py routes get_positions/place_order
                     to this venue's own block when a strategy is bound to it
  native_units       rows are diffed in lots, not account currency
  perp               False: manager/close_symbol.py refuses it
  windows_identity   only a password-logon Windows Administrator can log in
                     to it: flatten skips it under any other identity, the
                     report's can_flatten says so, the reconciler service
                     runs as Administrator
  resolved_contracts positions come back as root+YYMM contract codes
                     (TM2610) that flatten maps to the book key (TMF)
  lots_close_partial flatten closes its lots through close_position_partial
                     (not place_contract_market_order)
  close_needs_fill   flatten books a close as done only on a confirmed fill
  reference          the onboarding doc chat binding points to
  label              the broker's name in user-facing messages
  cred_env           the venue's own .env names that do not follow the
                     {ID}_API_KEY / _PASSWORD pair shape, with their role
                     (API_KEY = the name that says "bound", PASSWORD = its
                     secret, EXTRA = belongs to the venue, pairs nothing) —
                     read before that shape so every discovery site (runtime
                     _venue_cred_ids / venues() / account_reader, flatten)
                     sees the venue and a rebind evicts all of its names
