# brokers keep their hand-wired signed-diff reconcilers and never come here).
#
# Market orders place synchronously, exactly the pre-execution behaviour.
# TWAP / custom run in a DAEMON THREAD so a 30-minute window never blocks the
# reconcile loop (other symbols keep trading, heartbeat stays fresh):
#   - while a symbol's execution is in flight, further legs for that symbol
#     return False (the reconcile "intentionally skipped" contract) — the
#     residual gap is simply re-observed next round;
#   - a target that FLIPS direction mid-flight sets the stop event; the thread
#     exits before its next slice and the completion kick re-reconciles;
#   - completion touches state/execution/kick (watched by the reconciler) so
#     convergence resumes within one poll instead of the 5-minute heartbeat;
#   - a reconciler restart drops the in-memory registry and any thread with it:
#     the residual gap re-dispatches fresh on the next round — self-healing.
