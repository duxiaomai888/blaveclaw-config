"""
President Futures (統一期貨) domestic futures orders — Unitrade API (`pip
install unitrade`). TXF / MXF / TMF market orders only. Companion reference:
references/president-broker.md (read it before any 統一 work).

Taiwan-broker shape, like lib/order_capital.py (NOT lib/order_TEMPLATE.py's
perp contract): quantities are 口 (lots), symbols are the canonical roots
TXF / MXF / TMF, the lib maps them to a month contract (TXFJ6 = TXF, J=Oct, 6=2026).

Design rules:
1. ENTRY → COMPUTED NEAR MONTH, CLOSE → THE ROW'S OWN CONTRACT. Contracts
   settle at 13:30 Taipei on the third Wednesday of their month (the backtest's
   TXFR1 series keeps the expiring month through that 13:30 close; its first
   new-month bar is the 15:00 evening session). New positions roll at the
   night session before it: from 15:00 the day before settlement entries go to
   the next month (entry_roll_at — why: see there). The computed contract must
   appear in the broker's get_domestic_contracts list, else the order is
   refused. A reduce/close goes to the productid of the position row it closes
   (lib/account_president's snapshot) with opencloseflag "1" (close only), and
   only after the snapshot confirms the side and the size: a reduce that would
   add to or reverse a position, or a snapshot whose read started less than
   ORDER_SETTLE_S after this contract's last send, is refused before the login
   (_claim: check + send marker under one machine-wide lock; the marker is
   written again right before the send, so a slow login does not eat the
   margin). An entry goes to the month already held for that root (never two
   months at once — covers the settlement window and holiday-postponed
   settlements), else the computed near month, and waits (EntryDeferred) while
   the snapshot has not caught up.
   NOT verified across a real settlement day.
2. SENT ≠ ACCEPTED ≠ FILLED. order() returning issend=True only means the
   request left this machine. Accepted = an on_reply for OUR seq with
   a success status code (0000/0001/0003/0004/0006 — live market orders
   answer 0004 directly). A fill = on_match rows for
   the orderno that reply carried (on_match has no seq). No fill seen within
   confirm_timeout returns status 'sent' with fill_qty 0 — an IOC the market
   did not take, or a fill not yet reported; the IOC-cancel report has never
   been observed (the test host never fills). Never resubmit on 'sent'.
3. NO CLIENT ORDER ID AT THE BROKER. `note` (≤10 chars) is only a label. A
   client_tag is refused locally if it was already sent today
   (state/president_order_tags.json, recorded once the broker took the send,
   under a cross-process lock held from the check to the record). A process
   killed between the send and the record leaves the tag reusable — the
   snapshot check on reduces is the backstop there.
4. HALTABLE + AUDITED. guard.check_restart_stop first, then HALT blocks
   entries (closes always pass); every send audits order_sent / order_error /
   order_filled.
5. ONE SESSION PER CALL, ALWAYS LOGGED OUT. Unitrade starts non-daemon
   threads at login; a process that skips logout() never exits. Concurrent
   logins with the worker's session were measured fine on the test host.
6. NO BROKER ATTRIBUTION, NO NATIVE STOP ORDERS, NO LIMIT LAYER here —
   place_stop_order / cancel_order / modify_order are stubs like
   order_capital's. The chase executor's limit functions are deliberately
   absent (not stubbed): lib.venue_wiring detects the limit layer by hasattr,
   and absence is what makes a chase request fall back to market loudly.

Credentials: president_account / president_password / president_test_url /
president_ca_path / president_ca_password (+ president_url for production,
switched on only by the binding flow's vault) — resolved by lib/president_vault.py.
