"""
Bybit account library — Unified Trading Account (UTA) equity, positions,
holdings and external cash flows.

Discovered by filename (lib.account_bybit.get_equity / get_positions).
Credentials: BYBIT_API_KEY / BYBIT_SECRET_KEY in .env (the web 下單設定 names).

Wallet model: a UTA account has exactly TWO wallets and they need TWO different
endpoints — /v5/account/wallet-balance accepts only accountType=UNIFIED (every
other type returns retCode 10001), while the FUND wallet is only readable via
/v5/asset/transfer/query-account-coins-balance (which in turn cannot enumerate
UNIFIED — it demands an explicit 1-10 coin list). Orders draw on UNIFIED, so
that is the equity base for sizing; FUND money cannot trade and is NOT counted
in totalEquity, which is exactly why it must appear in the breakdown.

Spot has no separate wallet here: a spot buy lands in the UNIFIED coin array
and doubles as margin.

UTA ONLY. A classic (non-UTA) account exposes different account types that were
never verified against a real account, so it raises instead of guessing.
