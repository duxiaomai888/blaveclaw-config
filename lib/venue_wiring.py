"""
Auto-wiring: routes the reconciler through the machine's OFFICIAL venue libs.

Why this exists (measured 2026-08-04/05 on the onboarding test machine): the
reconciler template shipped with NotImplementedError stubs and relied on the
agent hand-wiring them per venue. Three failure modes followed — a venue whose
official libs were all present still crash-looped on the stubs ("page says
ready, reconciler is a shell"); rebinding to another exchange left the old
hand-wiring pointed at a venue whose keys were gone (auto-halt storms); and
every hand-wiring re-implemented the same USD-diff mapping with fresh bugs.
This module IS that mapping, written once, with every harvested fix baked in.

Scope: venues whose BOTH lib/account_{id}.py AND lib/order_{id}.py ship
officially (see references/exchange-connect.md rule 2). Venues without
official libs still need a hand-wired reconciler — the template's stubs say
how. Taiwan brokers (sinopac signed-diff contract) are NOT routed here.

Key contract (lib/portfolio): plain "BTCUSDT" keys = perp/swap,
"BTCUSDT@spot" = spot inventory (market_key/split_key); spot actuals come
from spot_scope() so removing a spot strategy sells its inventory down and
personal coins never enter.
