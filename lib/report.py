"""
Report helper — build a report and drop it in `workspace/reports/`.

A report is a JSON document the platform stores and the web workspace renders in
its Reports list (charts, KPI rows, tables, prose). The machine publishes one by
landing a file at `workspace/reports/<id>.json`. **The write is the finish line:**
the runtime's uploader (a 2-minute timer) ships it and moves the file to
`reports/sent/`, or to `reports/failed/` plus a line in
`reports/upload_errors.log`. Do not wait for the upload before saying the report
is produced.

This module is a convenience only — the drop directory is the contract, so a
report written with `json.dump` into that path works exactly the same. What it
saves you: the atomic write the contract requires, the envelope boilerplate, the
mandatory leading `meta` block, the image sidecar (written before the JSON, in
the order the contract requires), and the three-directory status check.

Block types and their fields: `references/reports.md`.

Usage:
    from lib.report import write_report

    path = write_report(
        "mcpt-2317-20260901",
        "2317 策略績效勝過 98.8% 的隨機排列",
        [
            {"type": "text", "variant": "lead", "markdown": "p = 0.012..."},
            {"type": "kpi_row", "items": [
                {"label": "p-value", "value": "0.012", "tone": "neutral"}]},
            {"type": "image", "file": "perm.png", "alt": "permutation histogram"},
        ],
        type="research",
        report_type="一次性",
        images={"perm.png": open("tmp/perm.png", "rb").read()},
    )

Diagnosis only — never the next step after `write_report`. Reach for it when a
report never appeared or you suspect it was refused:

    status("mcpt-2317-20260901")   # 'pending' | 'sent' | 'failed: <reason>' | 'unknown'

            web shows it back to them as the report's description.
    cron    standard 5-field cron (no `@daily`, no seconds), **written in the user's own
            wall-clock time, exactly as they said it**: 台北 08:30 is `30 8 * * *`, full
            stop. Do NOT convert it to the machine's clock — the runtime evaluates the
            cron in `tz` (below), so a conversion would shift the report by that offset
            a second time. The same expression works on Linux and Windows.
    human   1–60 chars, the schedule in words (「每 4 小時」「每個交易日 08:30」);
            the only form the user ever sees, so make it match the cron exactly.
    script  the full text of run.py. It runs like a scheduled strategy: cwd is the
            workspace, every `BLAVE_*` variable stripped, no machine token; it
            publishes by writing into `reports/` (write_report / templates
            `publish(pack)`), and writes nothing when there is nothing to report.
    agent_consent  True only after you told the user a scheduled run wakes you and costs about
            `scheduled_cost()` points each time (on whatever model they are on then) and they
            said yes; False when they withdraw it; None (default) keeps what the job had — an
            edit does not drop it. Without it the job runs data-only, as every job registered
            before this existed does. True needs `scheduled_agent_available()` and a cron that
            fires at most hourly (one fixed minute) (references/reports.md §8).
    tz      IANA zone the cron is read in. Leave it out: it is taken from the machine's
            own setting (`state/timezone`, written by the platform from the user's
            browser). If that is missing this raises — ask the user which time zone they
            are in, record it with `set_timezone()`, then register; never guess one.
