"""
Report helper — build a report and drop it in `workspace/reports/`.

A report is a JSON document the platform stores and the web workspace renders in
its Reports list (charts, KPI rows, tables, prose). The machine publishes one by
landing a file at `workspace/reports/<id>.json`. **The write is the finish line:**
the runtime's uploader (a 2-minute timer) ships it and moves the file to
`reports/sent/`, or to `reports/failed/` plus a line in
`reports/upload_errors.log`. Do not wait for the upload before saying the report
is produced.

This module is a convenience only — the drop directory is the contract, so a
report written with `json.dump` into that path works exactly the same. What it
saves you: the atomic write the contract requires, the envelope boilerplate, the
mandatory leading `meta` block, the image sidecar (written before the JSON, in
the order the contract requires), and the three-directory status check.

Block types and their fields: `references/reports.md`.

Usage:
    from lib.report import write_report

    path = write_report(
        "mcpt-2317-20260901",
        "2317 策略績效勝過 98.8% 的隨機排列",
        [
            {"type": "text", "variant": "lead", "markdown": "p = 0.012..."},
            {"type": "kpi_row", "items": [
                {"label": "p-value", "value": "0.012", "tone": "neutral"}]},
            {"type": "image", "file": "perm.png", "alt": "permutation histogram"},
        ],
        type="research",
        report_type="一次性",
        images={"perm.png": open("tmp/perm.png", "rb").read()},
    )

Diagnosis only — never the next step after `write_report`. Reach for it when a
report never appeared or you suspect it was refused:

    status("mcpt-2317-20260901")   # 'pending' | 'sent' | 'failed: <reason>' | 'unknown'
