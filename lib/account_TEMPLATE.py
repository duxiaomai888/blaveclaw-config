# Account library template — copy to lib/account_{exchange}.py and implement below.
# Before implementing: read skills/blave-quant/references/{exchange}-skill.md for
# the correct balance and position endpoints, auth pattern, and response schema.
#
# API keys are already in .env — read the EXACT names that exist there (grep .env
# first). Web-connected exchanges arrive uppercase ({EXCHANGE}_API_KEY /
# {EXCHANGE}_SECRET_KEY / {EXCHANGE}_PASSPHRASE); some older integrations are
# lowercase (sinopac_api_key). Never invent or re-case names.
#
# Platform readers auto-import this file by name — keep the exact filename convention.

    Optionally add 'accounts': {name: float} — per-wallet breakdown (lowercase
    names like 'swap'/'spot'/'fund', USDT-denominated, best-effort), shown on
    the web so funds outside the trading account don't look like they vanished.

    Multi-account venues: equity = the account orders are placed on (it is the
    position-sizing base) — never the sum across spot/futures/funding accounts.

def get_positions(env: dict) -> list:
    """
    Query exchange for open positions.
    Returns [{'symbol': str, 'side': str, 'size': float, 'mark_price': float}, ...]
    Return [] if flat.

    'symbol' MUST be canonical dashless uppercase ('BTCUSDT', never 'BTC-USDT' /
    'BTC_USDT') — every shipped account_*.py normalizes to this and the
    reconciler keys target/actual on it. Callers comparing against a venue-format
    symbol must normalize BOTH sides first via lib.data.normalize_symbol (the
    single recipe — do not hand-roll replace chains); a raw
    comparison never matches and silently reads as "no position" (caused a live
    incident: strategy re-opened on top of an existing position).

    OKX pitfall: use the notionalUsd field directly — ctVal may be None for some
    instrument types, so computing pos * markPx * ctVal will silently return 0.

# OPTIONAL — implement when the venue has wallets holding coins outside the
