# ── Single-file cache layout (daily datasets) ─────────────────────────────────
#
# Monthly partitioning is right for minute bars (hundreds of thousands of rows,
# only the current month ever changes) but wrong for daily series: a 台股 daily
# dataset is ~20 rows / 7KB per month, so a 300-stock universe is 41,400 tiny
# parquets and the per-file open/parse/write overhead dominates everything.
# Measured on a real Windows customer box (2026-08-22, 300 stocks, 723k rows):
# cold write 41,400 monthly files ≈ 13 min vs 300 single files ≈ 2.3 s; warm
# read 32.0 s vs 1.1 s; the same 300-stock Type C backtest went 14.5 min cold /
# 57 s warm → 45 s cold / 15 s warm. So daily datasets keep ONE parquet per
# (prefix, id) whose parquet footer metadata carries what the monthly layout
# encoded in file names and mtimes: which months are covered (one contiguous
# range — fetch spans always fill the whole requested range, empty months
# included, so no empty-month markers are needed) and when the tail was last
# fetched (a month is complete iff it was fetched after it ended; the current
# month is delta-updated on every call, exactly as before). Meta lives INSIDE
# the parquet (schema metadata key b'blave_cache_meta'), so frame and coverage
# are always written together in one atomic replace — no sidecar that could
# describe somebody else's frame under concurrent writers.
#
# File: cache/{prefix}_{params}.parquet   all rows, tz-naive UTC index, sorted;
#       footer meta {"from": "YYYY-MM", "to": "YYYY-MM",
#                    "tail_fetched_at": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS"}

# into the single file on first touch and removed — machines already in the

    (興櫃 excluded, ETNs have no data) — about 2,400 rows. DataFrame with columns
    rank (1-based, market_value desc), stock_id, name, market_value (NTD 元,
    integer), market ('TWSE' 上市 / 'TPEx' 上櫃), is_etf (bool); the as-of
    publication date and the 上市 ex-ETF market-cap total ride along in
    `df.attrs['date']` ('YYYY-MM-DD') and `df.attrs['twse_ex_etf_market_value']`
    (NTD 元, int). Updated once a day after the close; server caches 30 min.

    `top` (int 1–3000) keeps the first N ranks, None = all. This is the first-layer
    screening filter for anything market-cap based (top-N pool, top-10 權值股) —
    never rebuild it from per-stock shares × price across the market.

    ETFs are in the ranking (0050 is rank 6) — filter them with the `is_etf`
    column: `df[~df['is_etf']]`. Never by stock_id prefix ('00' is a market
    convention rather than a contract, and it misses REITs like '01010T') and never
    by fetching a classification yourself — is_etf IS that classification (FinMind
    industry_category), and it is the same criterion the denominator uses, so the
    two can never disagree. is_etf False means 'not in the ETF set', NOT 'confirmed
    not an ETF': a security FinMind publishes no category for (REIT '01010T') is
    False and stays inside the denominator. `market` is a listing-board tag, not an
    ETF flag.

    `attrs['twse_ex_etf_market_value']` is the index-weight (權值比重) denominator:
    the sum of the market == 'TWSE' rows that are not ETFs on the same as-of day,
    whole-market regardless of `top` (REITs and preferred shares are NOT excluded
    from it). So market_value / twse_ex_etf_market_value is a weight only
    for a row whose market is 'TWSE' and which is not an ETF — over a TPEx or ETF
    row it is not a weight. `rank` is on a different universe — still 上市 + 上櫃
    including ETFs — so never present the ratio and the rank as one ranking.

    Single-file cache like fetch_twmarket_dividend_points: the FULL ranking is
    fetched once (one call, ~2.4k rows) and kept 1 hour, `top` is sliced locally,
    so repeat calls with different `top` are free within the hour. Whether attrs
    survive the parquet round-trip is pandas-version dependent, so it is NOT
    relied on: a cache hit that came back without the new column or without either
    attr is discarded and refetched. The returned frame therefore always carries
    both attrs, whatever the machine's pandas version."""

# fetched before the evening publish is served until the api's UTC date rolls over, 08:00
# Taipei the next day. The one remaining 待確認 per entry is named in its basis; those keep
