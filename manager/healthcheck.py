"""
Deployment healthcheck — alerts when something that SHOULD be running has gone quiet.

Complements manager/alert_failure.py:
  alert_failure.py fires when a run happened and CRASHED.
  healthcheck.py  fires when a run did NOT happen at all — lost cron entry,
                  dead daemon, wiped crontab, or "deployed" but never scheduled.

Data model (all under state/, which the nightly config sync never overwrites):
  state/deployments.json      registry of what should be running:
      {"<name>": {"type": "cron"|"daemon", "expect_every_minutes": 60,
                  "registered_at": "<iso>"}}
  state/heartbeat/<name>      touched after each successful run (run_strategy.sh)
                              or loop tick (daemons)
  state/healthcheck_alerts.json  last-alert timestamps (cooldown bookkeeping)

Cron (add ONCE — see references/deployment.md):
  */30 * * * * cd $BLAVECLAW_HOME/workspace && python3 manager/healthcheck.py
  (when unset, $BLAVECLAW_HOME's default is runtime-dependent — /root/.openclaw on old
  BlaveClaw machines, /opt/blave-agent on Blave Agent machines; resolve it per
  references/deployment.md. This script itself only uses workspace-relative paths and
  lib/notify.py's own resolution, so only the cron entry's cd needs the resolved value.)

Self-healing: any `run_strategy.sh <name>` OR `wait_for_bar.py <name>` entry
found in crontab is auto-registered, so strategies deployed before this
healthcheck existed are covered without anyone re-registering them. The
wait_for_bar.py case reads the strategy's own INTERVAL (its cron line always
runs every minute, so the line itself can't say how often the strategy is
meant to actually fire). Heartbeat files without a registry entry are never
alerted (a one-off manual run is not a deployment).
