def _symbol_threshold(symbol, reduce_only=False):
    """The reconcile gate for ONE symbol on ONE side.

    ENTRY legs: THRESHOLD, or the venue's own minimum order size when larger.
    venue_wiring._entry_qty rounds an entry half-up to a whole lot, so a gap
    under one lot buys a WHOLE lot and lands the position over target; the
    reduce leg that follows ceils to a whole lot and sells it back — on a
    coarse instrument (one BTC perp lot ≈ $78, against a flat gate of 10) that
    is a real buy/sell round trip every 300s, fees included. Gating entries at
    the venue's own minimum converges the leftover instead. Deliberately the
    ONE-LOT scale and not the half-lot rounding boundary: the boundary is not
    stable under a moving mark (a leftover of 0.53 lots would pass a half-lot
    gate and restart the churn).

    The 1.05 inside that minimum (lib.execute._venue_min_slice_usd) is there
    for THIS cache: the gate carries a mark up to MIN_ORDER_TTL_S old while the
    gap it judges is priced now. After a ceil-sell leaves the position 0.99
    lots short, a 2% rise inside the cache window would put the gap over a 1.0x
    gate — _entry_qty rounds it up to a whole lot, the next reduce ceils it
    back off, and the churn is back. Do not "simplify" it to 1.0 (pinned in
    tests/check_reconcile_threshold.py).

    REDUCE legs that leave part of the position (a shrink): THRESHOLD, or
    HALF a lot when larger. A leg that takes the WHOLE position off — target
    flat, or the close leg of a flip — never asks this function: lib.portfolio
    gates it at the flat THRESHOLD (`.flat` below, _close_threshold), see the
    end of this paragraph. The entry gate alone only shuts one direction of
    the churn — measured 2026-09-09 (uid 32321, 3 lots vs a $227 target): the
    mark drifted the position $10 over target, _reduce_qty ceiled that to a
    whole $79 lot, the flat gate let it through, and the resulting $69 gap was
    bought straight back. 442 real fills. Half a lot is the one value that
    converges on its own: an over-target under 0.5 lot is left alone; over it
    the ceil-sell leaves a gap of ceil(x) − x, i.e. < 1 lot, which is under the
    1.05-lot entry gate, so nothing buys it back. Anything ≥ one lot is fatal here: a
    position of exactly one lot could then not be closed or flipped AT ALL
    (the flat-10 rule this replaces was itself the fix for that P0), and any
    stale-mark buffer on top pushes toward that line — so none. 0.5 leaves a
    50% margin on a 60s-old mark. Under self_ledger a reduce leg is sized from
    the bot's own book and rounded to a lot (venue_wiring._book_reduce_qty), and
    the diff it is gated on is in the book's cost, not the mark — the gate is
    the same half lot, valued at the mark. That mismatch is why a whole-position
    close is NOT gated here: a one-lot book that more than doubled costs less
    than half a lot at the mark, so the signal said flat and no order went out,
    every round (N lots: mark/entry > 2N). Exempting it cannot bring the churn
    back — a full close leaves no ceil remainder, target 0 has no entry leg to
    buy it back, and a flip's entry leg is still gated at 1.05 lots. On an
    account-read book it changes nothing: a swap position is whole lots, always
    over half of one. Dust under the flat THRESHOLD is left alone either way.
    Spot and a failed lookup stay on the flat THRESHOLD.

    The whole-position close gate itself (`.close`, _close_gate) is THRESHOLD
    less half a lot while a lot is under 2×THRESHOLD, else THRESHOLD. An entry
    rounds half-up to whole lots, so the smallest position the bot opens from a
    THRESHOLD-sized gap is about THRESHOLD − ½ lot: one Gate.io / OKX BTC
    contract (0.0001 BTC ≈ $8.4) out of a $10 gap. Gated at the flat
    THRESHOLD, that position — the bot's own — could never be closed. The gate
    compares the book's cost to a lot at today's mark, so the band runs to two
    lots' worth, not one: the same contract still closes after the mark rose
    past $10 a lot. Dust under the line (a fine-grained instrument, where the
    line is ~THRESHOLD) is left alone as before.

    Native-unit rows (asset_spec.type futures_contracts / shares, capital) never
    reach here — lib.portfolio skips the account-currency threshold for them
    entirely. In account-read mode lib.portfolio also lays its drift band
    (max(5%, 2σ) of the target, same-side adjustments only) over both gates.
