"""One-time: write the self-ledger's baseline (manager/ledger_seed.json).
Run once when turning portfolio_config.json["self_ledger"] on — with the flag
on and NO baseline, the reconciler refuses to trade (fail-loud guard in
lib/portfolio.reconcile). Full onboarding recipe: references/manager.md §
self_ledger.

Two modes:

  python3 manager/seed_ledger.py
      Fresh start (DEFAULT — the right mode for a user who holds manual
      positions): everything currently on the account is the USER's; the bot
      starts from a zero book and only manages what it buys from now on.
      REQUIREMENT: the bot's own positions must be flat first — any live bot
      position becomes the user's, and the bot would re-buy its full target
      on top of it (doubled exposure).

  python3 manager/seed_ledger.py --absorb
      The account's current position is 100% BOT-owned as of now. Only for an
      account with NO manual positions mixed in (migrating a bot-only machine
      without closing anything). On a mixed account this adopts the user's
      manual positions into the bot's book and the bot will later trade them
      away — when unsure, do not use this mode.

Re-running (either mode) REPLACES the baseline and forgets every fill
recorded before now — never run this routinely or on a schedule.
