Blave Agent Strategy Manager

Computes the portfolio weights w for the live reconciler and updates
manager/portfolio_config.json.

Usage:
    python3 manager/manager.py [--lookback 365] [--notify]
    python3 manager/manager.py --apply   # actually write portfolio_config.json
    python3 manager/manager.py --allocator my_method   # use allocators/my_method/
    python3 manager/manager.py --members a,b --json manager/proposal.json
        # subset of strategies + machine-readable proposal (what the workspace
        # page's 跑優化 runs; --params-json '{"k": v}' overrides an allocator's PARAMS)

Default is DRY-RUN: weights are computed and printed but portfolio_config.json
is NOT touched. Pass --apply only after the user has confirmed the new weights.

Two built-in methods: `equal` (every strategy the same share) and `slope` (the
slope/std optimiser below). `--allocator <name>` picks either, or swaps in
allocators/<name>/allocator.py — see references/allocator-code.md.

Omitting `--allocator` does NOT mean `equal`: a portfolio that has already been
applied keeps the method it is live on (a config with a null or absent
`allocator` predates `equal`, so it means `slope`). Only a portfolio that has
never been applied falls to `equal` — which is the default for new portfolios
because a method that re-fits weights every day has to beat leaving them alone,
and the walk-forward gate is where it proves it.

This command ONLY recomputes weights / leverage. It never changes
account_value — that is the live position-sizing base (see lib/portfolio.py:
contribution = account_value * leverage * weight * position). To change capital,
edit portfolio_config.json["account_value"] directly as a separate, explicit step.

    """Two aligned daily-return matrices from load_all_stats() output.

    Returns (fit_df, real_df) — same index, same columns, differing only on the
    days a strategy has NO DATA: before its first backtest day, or after its
    last. `fit_df` charges those days ABSENT_FILL_ANNUAL; `real_df` puts 0
    there.

    Why the two differ. A weighting method that maximises a RATIO (the built-in
    slope/std, and most sensible methods) is scale-invariant: an absent leg
    contributes no return and no variance, so its weight divides the numerator
    and the denominator alike and cancels out. The method is then genuinely
    indifferent to how much it hands a strategy that did not exist yet — the
    objective is flat across the whole simplex and the optimiser stops wherever
    it started, which is how a walk-forward ends up allocating to strategies
    with no history and re-drawing that allocation every day. A small negative
    fill breaks the tie toward the legs that are actually live, and it is a
    handicap that decays on its own: it shrinks as real days fill the window,
    so a young strategy still earns weight, it just has to be worth its keep.

    The fill never reaches the money. `real_df` is what the portfolio actually
    returned, and a strategy that did not exist cannot have lost anything —
    charging the walk-forward's random benchmark for holding one would flatter
    the managed result it is supposed to be a benchmark for.

    A non-trading day is NOT an absent day: lib/pnl resamples every strategy to
    calendar days and writes an explicit 0, so a weekend or a market holiday
    arrives here as a real zero and is never filled. A NaN means no data.
