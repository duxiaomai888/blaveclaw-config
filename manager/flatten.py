"""Flatten: market-close the BOT's positions on every connected venue.

The web 暫停並全部平倉 runs this (the command listener trips state/HALT first,
then launches this detached); it is also runnable by hand:

    cd workspace && python3 manager/flatten.py

Scope — what "the bot's positions" means (lib.portfolio.own_positions_only;
every machine since 2026-09-23 unless its config says "self_ledger": false):
  - own positions only: ONLY the bot's own ledger positions
    (lib.portfolio.ledger_positions) are closed — the user's manual positions
    on the same account are never touched, not even by this button. Matches
    the 3Commas/Cryptohopper panic semantics the 暫停下單 dialog was modeled
    on. Each close is the QUANTITY the book says the bot bought, capped at
    what the account actually holds on that side (a manually-shrunk position
    closes what exists). Only a legacy row — a book with no quantity, see
    lib.portfolio.ledger_book — still converts its USD at the mark. No
    baseline yet → no swap close at all (said loudly), never the whole account.
  - "self_ledger": false (explicit opt-out): EVERY open position on the
    account — the whole account is the bot's world, no ledger to scope by.

Semantics — panic button, not portfolio management:
  - HALT is (re)tripped here too, so a manual run gets the same guarantee:
    nothing re-opens after the flatten (closes always pass the guard; only the
    user pressing 啟動下單 clears the halt). Exception: after a machine restart
    (lib/guard.RESTART_STOP_PATH) no HALT is added and the closes pass only on
    the one-time pass the platform's close_all hands us (guard.claim_close_all_pass);
    the machine stays stopped afterwards.
  - Venues are discovered like the account reader: {PREFIX}_API_KEY in .env,
    flattenable iff BOTH lib/account_{id}.py and lib/order_{id}.py exist.
    A venue with positions but no order lib is reported loudly and skipped.
  - Dust below the exchange minimum can't be closed (format_qty gate) — it is
    logged and left; the exchange rejects sub-minimum orders anyway.
  - SPOT: own positions only → each spot book row (ledger key "SYM@spot")
    sells min(book quantity, wallet); the wallet is one pool of the bot's and
    the user's coins, so the user's same-coin coins are never sold. A book row
    with no quantity (legacy) is not sold at all and says why. Opt-out → the
    managed inventory (lib/portfolio.spot_scope — strategy symbols +
    previously-managed) is sold to zero; personal coins in untargeted symbols
    are never touched. Spot dust below the venue's sell minimum is logged and
    left, same rule as swap.
  - SINGLE-FLIGHT. 暫停 and 全部平倉 are always pressable (a kill switch that
    greys out because the last press is still in flight is not a kill switch),
    so close_all IS re-sent — and a second flatten is not a harmless repeat.
    It re-reads positions, and every venue whose close cannot be expressed as
    reduce-only re-sends a plain market order into a book the first flatten is
    already emptying: on 群益 (lib/order_capital) the close is sNewClose=2
    「auto 新倉/平倉」, which on an already-closed position opens a NEW position
    the other way — and its positions come from lib/capital_worker's snapshot,
    good for up to 300s, so the second flatten doesn't even need to win a race
    to read a position that is already gone. (Crypto is narrower: the venue
    itself refuses the duplicate — reduceOnly on one-way/net, and in hedge mode
    positionSide/posSide pins the slot so an oversized close is rejected, never
    flipped — but it still doubles the orders.jsonl close legs the user reads
    as 交易歷史, and races zero_ledger_symbols.) So: one flatten per machine,
    enforced by state/flatten.lock; a second one exits immediately rather than
    queueing — the user pressing again means "stop faster", not "stop twice".
  - Every close is appended to manager/orders.jsonl with its confirmed fill,
    so the web 交易歷史 and the order toast show exactly what happened; the
    closed symbols' ledger baselines are zeroed afterwards
    (zero_ledger_symbols) so the closes are never re-summed as bot trades.
