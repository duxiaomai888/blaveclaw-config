"""Minimal check for the absent-day fill — `python3 manager/check_absent_fill.py`.

The two properties that go silently wrong if this breaks: a method fitting on
days a strategy did not exist (weights become optimiser noise again), and the
fill leaking into realised PnL (the walk-forward's random benchmark pays for
holding a strategy that never existed, flattering the managed result).
