## Multi-strategy bundle

**Submitting** — pack two or more strategies into one file using `# ===== STRATEGY N: <name> =====` delimiters, submit via the normal endpoint:

```python
# ===== STRATEGY 1: BTC SMA Cross =====
MODE          = "live"
STRATEGY_NAME = "btc_sma_cross"
SYMBOL        = "BTCUSDT"
# ... full strategy 1 code ...

# ===== STRATEGY 2: ETH RSI Fade =====
MODE          = "live"
STRATEGY_NAME = "eth_rsi_fade"
SYMBOL        = "ETHUSDT"
# ... full strategy 2 code ...
```

```
POST /openclaw/marketplace/strategies/submit
{"title": "BTC SMA + ETH RSI Bundle", "description": "...", "price": 500, "category": "bundle", "code": "..."}
```

In `description`, write a structured block for each strategy separated by `---`.

**Deploying** — when downloaded code contains `# ===== STRATEGY N:` markers:
1. Split at each marker into N separate strings
2. Save each to `/tmp/<name_slug>.py` (slug from the name after the colon)
3. Security scan each file separately; skip any that exit 2 (critical)
4. Move approved files to `strategies/<name_slug>.py` and run each with `python3`
