# Blave Agent

**Agentic Quant Workspace**

## Turn Your Agent into a Quant

Free and open source. Connect your Claude Code or Codex. You describe the idea; it writes the strategy, runs the backtest, and trades it live.

## What Makes It Different

### Backtests That Check Whether It Was Luck

- Every Type A backtest runs a Monte Carlo permutation test by default (MCPT, `lib/validation.py`) and records a p-value: could shuffled data have done as well?
- A parameter scan (`lib/param_scan.py`) looks for a plateau of parameters that all work, not the single best cell.
- Rolling walk-forward (`lib/walk_forward.py`) measures out-of-sample performance.
- The fee has to match the real market. A fee of 0 is flagged by `lib/quality_check.py` and treated as a bug.
- One idea gets one backtest by default. A poor result is reported as it is; the agent does not quietly re-tune the parameters until the numbers look good (see *Iteration Brakes* in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)).

### See Whether Live Runs the Code You Backtested

A backtest pins a version of the strategy. If the code running live no longer matches that version, the strategy is flagged — the web workspace shows "Live · file changed" instead of a clean "Live". The flag does not stop the strategy from running. It applies only to strategy types that are backtested (Type A and C), and only to strategies that have been versioned.

### No LLM in the Order Loop

The agent does the research and writes the code. Scheduled runs are deterministic code on a scheduler; `manager/reconciler.py` moves the account toward the target positions. A kill switch (`state/HALT`) blocks new exposure at the order-library level, while closes and stops still go through.

## Quick Start (From Source)

You need:

- macOS 13 or later. The packaged app is a universal build: Apple Silicon and Intel, one download.
- Node.js 22.12 or later, with npm (`shell/package.json` › `engines`)
- `python3` on your `PATH`. The packaged app bundles its own Python 3.12; running from source uses your system `python3` to create the venv.
- Claude Code or Codex installed and signed in, or a Blave account

```
git clone https://github.com/Blave-TW/blave-agent.git
cd blave-agent/shell
npm install
npm start
```

On first launch you choose what powers the agent:

- **Your own Claude Code or Codex.** No Blave account needed, and Blave charges nothing for the AI. The app only launches the CLI; your Claude Code or Codex credentials stay with it.
- **Blave AI.** Sign in with a Blave account; billed by usage.

Then describe an idea. For example:

- "Backtest BTCUSDT on the 4h chart: long when the 20-period SMA crosses above the 60-period SMA, flat when it crosses back below. Use a 0.05% fee per side."
- "Build a portfolio of BTC, ETH and SOL with equal weights, rebalanced weekly, and backtest it."
- "Scan both SMA lengths on that strategy and show me where the plateau is."

The agent sorts every idea into one of three types before writing code:

| Type | What it is | Backtest |
|---|---|---|
| A | One fixed symbol on a fixed interval; one position (long / short / flat) | Required |
| C | A portfolio: N symbols and a weight vector that sums to at most 1, rebalanced on a schedule | Required |
| B | Everything else: screeners, grids, arbitrage, alerts, one-off execution | None |

The interface follows the system language (English or Traditional Chinese). To override: `BLAVE_LANG=en npm start`.

## News

- **2026-09-24** — Desktop 0.1.1: first public release, universal build (Apple Silicon and Intel), on GitHub Releases. Taiwan stock daily bars and the Crypto Fear & Greed index now come from free public sources on the desktop.
- **2026-09-23** — Desktop 0.0.4, signed and notarized, on the test track.
- **2026-09-21** — The desktop app can connect a real Binance account and trade from your Mac.
- **2026-09-19** — Licensed under Apache-2.0.

## Venues and Data

**Venues with a tested order library** (`lib/account_*.py` + `lib/order_*.py`, verified on real accounts):

- Binance, BingX, OKX, Gate.io, Bybit — futures and spot
- Capital Futures (群益期貨) — Taiwan index futures and Taiwan stocks; Windows workspace only (its API is a Windows COM component, see `references/capital-broker.md`)

How a venue gets connected depends on where the agent runs:

- **Desktop app:** Binance, OKX, BingX, Gate.io and Bybit are connected in the app under Auto trading › Connect an exchange, which checks the key with the exchange first. A key pasted in chat is rejected — use Connect an exchange instead. Anything pasted stays in your chat history, so rotate a key you pasted by mistake. Portfolio (Type C) strategies cannot be auto-traded from the desktop app yet.
- **Cloud machine:** bind a venue on the web workspace's Auto trading page, or paste a Binance, BingX, OKX, Gate.io or Bybit key in chat and the agent binds it with `lib.venue.bind`.

For any other exchange or broker with an API, the agent can write a helper from `lib/account_TEMPLATE.py` and `lib/order_TEMPLATE.py`. That code has not been tested by Blave.

**Paper trading** needs no keys. It ships as `lib/account_paper.py` + `lib/order_paper.py` and fills at the latest close from the strategy's own data source (`lib/paper_data.py`).

**Data.**

- Desktop app, no account needed: crypto klines from Binance (USDT-M perpetuals, all intervals, back to listing) and BingX public endpoints; Taiwan stock daily bars straight from TWSE and TPEx with the exchanges' own ex-dividend adjustment (listed from 2010, OTC from the 1990s); the Crypto Fear & Greed index from alternative.me (since 2018). Blave's indicators, Taiwan intraday and flow data, futures and the macro calendar need a Blave account with data access.
- Cloud machine: market data comes from the Blave API through `lib/data.py` — crypto klines and indicators, Taiwan stocks, futures.

## Safety and Limits

- **Where exchange keys live depends on the surface.** Desktop app: in the workspace `.env` on your Mac (`~/Blave/workspace/.env`). Cloud machine: in the workspace `.env` on your own dedicated machine. A venue bound on the web page: stored encrypted by Blave. The agent can read the workspace `.env`; its rules forbid printing key values (`references/exchange-connect.md`). Give a key read and trade permission only, never withdrawal. A key with withdrawal permission is refused when you connect it (Binance, OKX, BingX, Bybit — desktop app, cloud machine and web page alike). Gate.io does not report the flag at all, so check that one yourself.
- Funding amounts and resuming trading are done by you — in the desktop app's Auto trading page, or on the web workspace for a cloud machine. The agent refuses to do them for you, even when asked. The one thing it may always do by itself is trip the kill switch.
- On the desktop app, orders only go out while Blave is running; after you quit and reopen it, trading stays paused until you press Start trading.
- The agent verifies before it reports: it re-reads a file after editing it, and queries an order back from the exchange before saying it was placed. Every order attempt is logged to `state/audit.jsonl`.
- A backtest describes the past. It does not predict or guarantee future results. MCPT and parameter scans lower the odds that you are looking at luck; they do not remove them.
- Nothing here is investment advice. Trading can lose money, including all of it.

## Run It in the Cloud (Paid)

If a strategy should keep running with your computer off, Blave Agent runs the same workspace on a dedicated cloud machine. You talk to the agent from the web workspace or Telegram; SSH is there if you want it. You can also connect your own Claude Code, Codex or another MCP-capable agent to that machine — setup is in the web workspace under Settings › Connect, guide at [blave.org/docs/en/connect](https://blave.org/docs/en/connect). Plans and prices: [blave.org/agent/en](https://blave.org/agent/en).

## Running From Source: What Goes Where

The first time you connect, the app prepares `~/Blave/`:

- `~/Blave/workspace/` — `lib/`, `manager/`, `references/`, `examples/`, `allocators/`, the strategy templates, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `VERSION`, copied from this checkout
- `~/Blave/venv/` — created with `python3 -m venv`, then `claude-agent-sdk`, cryptography, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pyarrow, requests, python-dotenv and scipy are installed with pip
- `~/Blave/state/` — chat sessions, chat images and trading state

Your strategies end up in `~/Blave/workspace/strategies/<name>/`. When running from source, the official files are copied again on every launch, so edit `lib/` in the checkout, not in `~/Blave/workspace/`. Your strategies, `.env` and state are never overwritten.

## Layout

| Path | What is in it |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | The agent's rules: verify before reporting, iteration limits, data sources, deployment redlines. Start here. |
| `lib/` | Shared library: data, backtest runner, MCPT, parameter scan, walk-forward, reports, charts, watchboard, exchange account and order helpers (`account_*.py`, `order_*.py`), kill switch (`guard.py`) |
| `strategies/` | Strategy templates. Your own strategies live here too and are git-ignored. |
| `examples/` | Complete reference strategies (crypto, crude oil, Taiwan stocks, Taiwan index futures) and export templates — see [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) |
| `references/` | What the agent reads before acting: library signatures, strategy code rules, deployment, broker guides, report contract |
| `manager/` | Portfolio manager, reconciler, health check, stop / flatten tools |
| `allocators/` | Template for a custom portfolio weighting method |
| `runtime/` | The agent loop, web and Telegram bridges, reporters and job runner that ship to every cloud machine, plus the desktop app's local order daemon |
| `shell/` | The desktop app (Electron) |
| `tests/` | Small checks, one file per contract |

Versions: the workspace is [`VERSION`](VERSION) (date-based); the runtime is `runtime/VERSION`, history in [`runtime/CHANGELOG.md`](runtime/CHANGELOG.md); the desktop app is `shell/package.json`.

About the `openclaw` name: it is the name of an earlier framework. Config files (`openclaw.json`), API paths (`/openclaw/...`) and SSH host names still carry it because those locations really are called that. The runtime in `runtime/` has been first-party since 2026-07-25 and is unrelated to that product.

## Just Reading the Code

1. [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — how the agent is expected to behave
2. [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) — eight complete strategies, each showing one pattern
3. [`references/lib.md`](references/lib.md) and [`references/strategy-code.md`](references/strategy-code.md) — library signatures and strategy code rules
4. [`strategies/TEMPLATE_A.py`](strategies/TEMPLATE_A.py) and [`strategies/TEMPLATE_C.py`](strategies/TEMPLATE_C.py)

Each file in `tests/` states how to run it in its header, for example `python tests/check_param_scan.py` or `node tests/check_shell_strings.js`.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Before a PR:

- run the checks in `tests/` that cover what you changed;
- activate secret scanning once per clone: `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`;
- leave the backtest-chain files (`lib/runner.py`, `param_scan.py`, `walk_forward.py`, `validation.py`, `analysis.py`) alone unless the change is about them — the web workspace reads their output files by contract.

## For maintainers and existing machines

### Releasing the runtime

```
cd blave-agent
export BLAVE_S3_KEY=... BLAVE_S3_SECRET=... BLAVE_S3_REGION=... BLAVE_S3_BUCKET=...
python publish.py            # dry-run, no credentials needed
python publish.py publish    # real upload; the fleet picks it up within ~6 minutes
```

Before publishing, bump `runtime/VERSION` and move the Unreleased lines in `runtime/CHANGELOG.md` under the new version. Packaging takes the unit files declared in `jobs.json` from `../api/blave_agent/systemd/`, so **the api checkout must sit next to this repo**; if it is missing, the run fails on the spot with the full path.

The history of `runtime/` was merged in from the api repo as a subtree on 2026-09-18 (165 commits). Because it was a merge and not a rename, `git log -- runtime/` shows only that merge; for the full history use `git log HEAD^2` (files are at root paths on that line, e.g. `agent_turn.py`).

Fresh installs are handled automatically by the provisioning script — no manual steps needed.

**Bump `VERSION` (date, `YYYY-MM-DD`, add `-b`/`-c` for same-day repushes) in the same commit as any change machines should pick up** — the platform compares each machine's reported VERSION against this repo's to light the web "update available" indicator; an unbumped push is invisible to users.

### Updating an existing workspace

This section is an operating contract: `references/updating.md` sends agents here, and the desktop app copies the same file list. Keep the heading and the list intact.

Tell your agent:

> Clone https://github.com/Blave-TW/blave-agent to /tmp/oc-config and use it as **reference** to update this machine's live workspace — `$BLAVE_AGENT_HOME/workspace`, i.e. the workspace you are running in (`/root/.openclaw/workspace` on old BlaveClaw machines, `/opt/blave-agent/workspace` on Blave Agent machines; resolution per `references/deployment.md`). For each file below, compare the repo version with the local version. Nothing is merged: an official file (its exact path is in the clone) that differs is replaced wholesale by the clone's version, after a backup of the local copy into `.official-backup/<old VERSION>-<UTC time>/` (relative path kept; older backups never overwritten). If the local copy matches no past official version of that file (`git hash-object` vs `git log --raw` on a `--filter=blob:none` clone), it was changed on this machine: ask the user before replacing it; if they keep it, leave it and do not copy `VERSION`. Replace atomically (`cp` to a temp name, then `mv`). A file whose path is not in the clone is never touched.
>
> - `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` — replace wholesale (these are config, not user-edited)
> - `references/` — replace each differing file wholesale (with the `.official-backup/` copy); copy in any that are missing
> - `strategies/TEMPLATE_A.py`, `strategies/TEMPLATE_C.py` — replace wholesale
> - `lib/` — add any canonical files that are missing locally (`venue_errors.py` always); every canonical file that differs — the backtest-chain files (`runner.py`, `param_scan.py`, `walk_forward.py`, `validation.py`, `analysis.py`), `data.py`, the official broker libs and the rest — is replaced wholesale (with the `.official-backup/` copy), never merged. For `lib/order_*.py` / `lib/account_*.py`, the name alone doesn't tell you if it's user-created: if that exact filename exists in the reference clone (e.g. `order_bingx.py`, `order_sinopac.py`, `account_bingx.py`, `account_TEMPLATE.py`), it is official and replaced like the rest; **never touch** one that does not exist in the reference clone — that's the user's own exchange integration
> - `manager/` — replace wholesale (user edits live in `portfolio_config.json`, not in the scripts)
> - `examples/` — replace wholesale
> - `allocators/` — replace wholesale (only files that exist in the clone; the user's own allocators are never touched)
> - `VERSION` — copy verbatim, always last and only if every step above succeeded (it declares the workspace up to date; drives the web "update available" indicator)
>
> When done, remove /tmp/oc-config.
