"""TW-futures book vs account, through the reconciler's whole round — no broker.

The 10-07 position-source audit read two real-money gaps out of the code; this
reproduces them through what the daemon actually calls each round:
lib.portfolio.reconcile(get_positions_fn=reconciler._get_positions_guarded,
place_order_fn=reconciler.place_order, threshold=reconciler._symbol_threshold),
with a real strategy state.json, portfolio_config.json and ledger_seed.json, the
book built by the round's own fill recording, and the REAL lib/account_capital +
lib/order_capital (only the SKCOM session and the worker's snapshot file are
faked; the fake venue applies sNewClose=2 as "net += lots in the month the alias
resolves to", which is what auto new/close does).

Scenarios (each in its own child process and scratch dir):
  A   bot holds +2, the user closes it in the broker's app, the signal goes to 0.
      Right: nothing is sent (a reduce never exceeds what is held), the book is
      written off once the short read is confirmed (≥5 s apart). Before the fix
      (lib/portfolio.hand_wired_reduce_cap) a sell of 2 went out on sNewClose=2 and
      opened a short of 2 the book did not know about.
  B1  bot holds +1 of the expiring month, it cash-settles (row gone, alias now
      the next month), signal unchanged. Right: the book drops the settled lots
      and re-enters 1 lot in the next month.
  B2  same, but the read just before the settled read failed. Right: no HALT.
  B2R same, but the reconciler restarts right after settlement. Right: no HALT.
  B3  same as B1, then the signal goes to 0. Right: nothing is sent.
  A2  the user closes 1 of the bot's 2, signal 0: sell 1 only, book written off to 0.
  A3  manual close, then the signal flips to -1 (2 lots): the short entry waits for the
      confirmed read, never sells more than 2 in total.
  A4  the user closes 1 of the bot's 2, the signal halves (target 1): the user's close already
      did the reduce — nothing is sent, the book comes down to 1 on the confirmed read (it
      used to sell the last lot, leave the book at 1 over an empty account, and never notice);
      the exit then sells exactly that 1 lot.
  A5  the user closes 1 of the bot's 3, the signal goes to 1/3 (target 1): sells 1, not 2,
      and the book ends at what the account holds.
  A6  the bot holds 3 in this month; two reads in a row show this root only in the NEXT month
      (1 lot — a month the venue lib misjudged, a snapshot behind), signal 1/3. Right: that is
      not a manual close — nothing sent, the book stays 3, one order_error asks for a human;
      once the read shows the real 3 again the reduce of 2 goes out. Before the cross-check
      the book was rebased to 0 on the second read and the bot re-entered on top of its own
      3 lots.
  F   a plain flip +2 -> -2 with nothing manual, the entry leg reading a snapshot from
      before its own close: the entry waits a round, no order error (統一 used to re-split
      the entry against that stale snapshot, try a second close and log a P1).
  M   the user holds 1 lot in the bot's own month (same side): the bot's exits sell only
      its own 2 lots, every time.
  M2  same, but the user's lot is on the OTHER side: the bot's entry nets into it at the
      broker, and today nothing records that (futures have no netted_qty), so the exit
      does not hand it back (known gap).
  R1  the user holds the next month on the other side while the bot holds this month:
      the bot's read is its own month only (群益 used to net the months to 0 and write the
      bot's lot off), and its exit sells its own month.
  R2  the user holds the next month (same side); this month settles, the next month
      becomes the front month: it stays the user's (the book did not record it) — the bot
      re-enters beside it and later sells only its own lot.
  H1  2026-02: settlement postponed from 02-18 to 02-23 (Lunar New Year). Past 02-18
      13:30 the February contract still trades: kept, nothing re-entered; once it
      settles on 02-23 the book drops it and re-enters in March.
  H2  the same for 2023-01 (01-18 -> 01-30).

President (統一) runs the same scenarios when lib/order_president.py exists
(another branch); on main they are skipped. Every contract-calendar "now" is
frozen (freeze_clock); the 5 s sleeps are real (note_account_short's spacing).

A scenario that fails because of a real bug asserts the intended behaviour and is
listed in KNOWN_BUGS: reported "xfail", and fails the run the day it passes
(take it off the list in the same change) — tests/check_paper_scenarios.py's rule.
