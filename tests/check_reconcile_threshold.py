"""Minimal check for the per-symbol ENTRY gate — no network.

What it protects (measured in review 2026-09-08, after 8fbecec shipped entry
rounding): on a coarse instrument an entry rounds half-up to a whole lot and
lands the position up to half a lot OVER target; the reduce leg that follows
ceils to a whole lot and sells it back; the next entry buys it again. Against a
flat gate of 10 that is a real buy/sell round trip every heartbeat — one BTC
perp lot is ~$78, so every leg clears 10 easily. Gating ENTRIES at the venue's
own minimum converges the leftover instead.

Reduce legs get HALF a lot (measured 2026-09-09, uid 32321: the entry gate
alone left the other direction open — a $10 over-target was ceil-sold as a
whole $79 lot and bought straight back, 442 fills). Never a whole lot: they
ceil and cap at the position, so a position of exactly one lot has to stay
closable and flippable — and that holds on a stale mark too.

Asserts: a one-lot position closes and flips out, incl. against a ±2%-stale
gate; sub-lot buy-backs (half a lot, and a drifted 0.6 lot) place nothing; a
shrink under half a lot places nothing while one over it does, and the sell it
ceils to converges the next round; an entry over the gate still trades;
spot / fine-grained instruments / a failed lookup keep the flat 10 on the
reduce side; a failed LOT read alone costs the reduce side only and leaves the
entry gate standing; capital/lot rows pass untouched with zero venue lookups;
the gate is cached per round and expires.
