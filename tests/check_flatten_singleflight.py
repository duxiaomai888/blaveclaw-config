"""manager/flatten.py single-flight — no network, no exchange, no crontab.

Why this exists: 暫停 and 全部平倉 are always pressable (a kill switch that
greys out mid-flight is not a kill switch), so close_all IS re-sent, and
_cmd_close_all used to Popen a detached flatten for every single press. A
second flatten re-reads positions and re-closes them; on 群益 the close is
sNewClose=2「auto 新倉/平倉」 against a snapshot up to 300s old, i.e. a real
reversed position on a real account.

Asserts: a second flatten cannot take the lock and does not wait; flatten()
reports ALREADY_RUNNING and touches nothing (never reads .env, never trips
HALT, never zeroes the ledger); a SIGKILLed holder leaves NO stale lock (the
next flatten gets it — the lock must not become a new way to brick the panic
button); a lone flatten runs to completion; and _cmd_close_all acks
close_all=already_running without launching a second process.
