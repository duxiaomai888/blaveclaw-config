"""Minimal check for the ENTRY gate recorded into the reconcile snapshot — no network.

What it protects: the silent case. On a coarse instrument a gap under one lot
places nothing and raises nothing — the workspace showed "目標 100 / 實際 78 /
差 22" with no order and no error, and no way to say why. compute_diff now
writes the gate it actually used into manager/last_reconcile.json["gates"], so
the page can name the number instead of guessing it (it is not recomputable
off-machine: venue minimum × mark, read with the user's keys).

Asserts: a diff stuck between the flat 10 and the venue gate places nothing yet
IS recorded with its gate and its signed diff; a diff over the gate trades and
is recorded all the same (the form prompt needs the number either way); a
flat-gate symbol (spot) trades and stays OUT; a reduce leg is recorded with its
own (half-lot) gate and `side: "reduce"` — entry rows carry no `side`, their
shape is unchanged; EVERY recorded row carries both sides (`entry_usd` /
`reduce_usd`, same values whichever side the round took) because the page
colours a live diff that may have flipped sign since; a row whose reduce side
is the flat 10 is recorded anyway when its entry side is not; lot-based rows
stay out; the key is present-but-empty when nothing qualifies.
