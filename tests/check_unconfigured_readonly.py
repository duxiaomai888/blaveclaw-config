"""Never-configured machine = read-only reconciler (Wei 2026-09-23).

Without manager/portfolio_config.json (amounts never saved) the target is
empty and, without self_ledger, every position on the account reads as "close
it" — the user's manual ones included. lib/portfolio.reconcile must read and
snapshot positions but send NOTHING. Saving amounts makes it trade — but
since 2026-09-23 only what the bot itself holds (tests/check_own_positions_only.py):
amounts all 0 closes the bot's book, never this manual long. The report says
which.

Then the two ways that guard was still losing the user's money (audit
2026-09-23):
  B1 — the read-only round writes manager/last_reconcile.json, and
  command_listener._fresh_portfolio_config() counted that file as "this
  machine has traded": the user's FIRST save then came out WITHOUT
  self_ledger, and the next round closed their manual position. Only
  orders.jsonl (an order really sent) counts. Tested through _cmd_amounts,
  the real save path.
  B2 — the report field ships with the runtime, the guard with the workspace
  lib: `portfolio_configured: false` may only be reported on evidence about
  the code that will actually run (a running reconciler's own snapshot, or —
  when it is not running — the lib on disk it will load next).

Run: cd blave-agent && .venv/bin/python tests/check_unconfigured_readonly.py
