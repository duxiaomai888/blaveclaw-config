"""Minimal check for the entry lot rounding + below-minimum silence — no network.

Covers the uid 32321 loop (2026-09-08): $289 on BTC perps is 3.7 lots of ~$78, so a
$227 target floored to 0.002 BTC and left a $70 residual that was above reconcile's
$10 THRESHOLD but below one lot — every round re-dispatched an order the venue could
never accept and logged it as "chase: no slices filled".

Asserts: venue_wiring._entry_qty rounds half-up to a whole lot (so the residual is
placeable and the next diff falls inside THRESHOLD), a sub-half-lot diff still rounds
to nothing, a failed rules read leaves qty untouched, BOTH USD->qty conversions
(market + chase limit) actually go through it, execute._finish stays silent on a
below-minimum no-op but still records a real zero-fill, and the orders.jsonl `failed`
flag is judged against the venue's real granularity instead of a flat $10.

Run: cd blave-agent && python3 tests/check_lot_rounding.py
