"""Taiwan-broker branches go through lib/venue_traits.py — no network.

1. Enumeration: every string constant equal to a TW broker id in manager/,
   lib/ and runtime/ (.py, via ast — docstrings, f-string messages and
   regexes that merely mention the name are not branches) sits in the trait
   table or in that broker's own files. A new `== "capital"` anywhere else
   fails here, so a broker's behaviour stays readable from one table.
2. runtime/venue_traits.py is byte-identical to lib/venue_traits.py (the
   runtime ships on its own channel and cannot import the workspace's copy).
3. Every hand_wired venue has a reconciler block and vice versa — a routed
   hand_wired venue without one would otherwise fall through to the crypto
   auto-wire with lot counts.
4. The derived venue sets match what the table encodes today.

Run: cd blave-agent && python3 tests/check_venue_traits.py
