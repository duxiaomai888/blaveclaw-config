"""Publish a runtime release to the central channel.

Packages runtime/ into a tar.gz, uploads it + an updated manifest to S3
(private bucket; machines never touch S3 — the api's /openclaw/agent/release/*
endpoints stream it to them behind proxy-token auth). Every deployed machine's
updater polls the manifest every 5 minutes, so an upload here reaches the whole
fleet within ~5 minutes (+60s api-side manifest cache).

Usage (from this repo's root; AWS creds come from the environment):
    python publish.py                     # dry-run: show what would ship
    python publish.py publish             # upload, whole fleet
    python publish.py publish --canary    # upload, only the api's canary user_ids
    python publish.py promote             # point the whole fleet at the canary version
    python publish.py lock                # after changing runtime/SDK_VERSION (network)

Canary: the tarball goes up as usual, but the manifest is written to
manifest-canary.json; the api (`release_manifest()`, `_RELEASE_CANARY_UIDS`)
serves it only to the listed users while it is newer than manifest.json.
`promote` copies it to manifest.json — same version number, same tarball.

SDK pin (runtime/SDK_VERSION): after changing it, `python publish.py lock`
resolves `claude-agent-sdk==<pin>` from wheels only for every platform the fleet
and the desktop run (SDK_TARGETS) and writes runtime/sdk-lock-<key>.txt — every
package of the tree pinned with the sha256 of each of its wheels. pip picks the
versions/wheels; the package set is the closure under each target's own PEP 508
markers (TARGET_ENV — pip evaluates markers on the Mac running it). Commit those
with the pin; publish refuses a missing or stale lock, re-checks each lock against
that closure using PyPI's Requires-Dist for the pinned versions (network, ~20s),
and ships them in the tarball (sdk_sync.py and provision install with
--require-hashes). Only pip (and its vendored `packaging`) is used — nothing else
to install on the publishing machine. A pin PyPI has
no win_amd64 wheel for (0.2.157, 0.2.160–0.2.163) fails `lock`: on Windows it
would never install (or, without --only-binary, install with no bundled CLI).

Credentials — this repo is PUBLIC, so nothing here reads api/common/config.py:
    BLAVE_S3_KEY      AWS access key id
    BLAVE_S3_SECRET   AWS secret access key
    BLAVE_S3_REGION   region (e.g. ap-southeast-1)
    BLAVE_S3_BUCKET   bucket name
A dry-run needs none of them; only `publish` does.

Version comes from runtime/VERSION — bump it first; re-publishing an existing
version number is refused (machines that rolled a version back skip re-attempts
of the same number, so a fix must ship under a new one).
