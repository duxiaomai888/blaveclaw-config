"""Local daemon: the desktop build's host for the live-trading chain.

One framework, two places to run it. This process runs the SAME scheduler
thread and the SAME command handlers as the cloud box (command_listener), the
same reconciler (manager/reconciler.py) and the same report builder
(portfolio_reporter.build_report). Only two things differ from the cloud:

  where commands come from   a file queue under <workspace>/state/local_cmd/
                             instead of the api's Redis queue
  who supervises the daemons this process, instead of systemd / NSSM

Design + the reasons behind each choice: blave-canon
output/specs/desktop-local-daemon-design-2026-09.md.

Command file (written by the app as <id>.json.tmp, then renamed):
    {"body": "<JSON string of {id, cmd, args, ts}>", "mac": "<hex>"}
    mac = HMAC-SHA256(secret, body as UTF-8 bytes)
The MAC is over the exact string, so the two ends never have to agree on a
canonical JSON. The secret arrives on stdin at startup — not in the environment
(`ps -E` shows that to the same user) and never on disk. `halt` alone is
accepted unsigned: it is the safe direction, the agent is allowed to pull it,
and it is the stop button that works while the app is shut.

What the MAC is NOT: isolation from the agent. The agent runs as the same OS
user, so it can still delete state/HALT, edit portfolio_config.json or .env,
import command_listener and call _cmd_resume, start its own reconciler, import
lib/order_*, or kill this daemon and start one with a secret of its own. The
cloud box has none of that isolation either — there, as here, those are
AGENTS.md behaviour rules. The MAC stops exactly two things: a command file the
agent drops into in/ (resume / amounts / credentials), and a replay of a real
one (ts window + the in-memory seen-id set; acks on disk are not trusted for it).

Ack: state/local_cmd/ack/<id>.json = {id, cmd, ok, result | error, ts} — the
same shape the api's /ack stores.
Status: state/local_status.json = build_report() + a "daemon" block.

"App gone = trading stops" rests on three guarantees, and Windows has none of
the primitives macOS uses for them — each has an equivalent here, chosen by
_nt(), the POSIX path untouched:
  1. parent watch   POSIX: select() on stdin + getppid() polling. Windows:
                    select() takes sockets only and a dead parent is never
                    re-parented, so _wait_parent_gone_nt runs two threads —
                    one blocked in read(0) (EOF / broken pipe = "parent closed
                    stdin"), one parked in WaitForSingleObject on the parent's
                    process handle (Task Manager kill, crash: the pipe is not
                    guaranteed to break first). First to return wins.
  2. lock           POSIX: flock, and the reconciler inherits the daemon's
                    locked fd (pass_fds) so the lock lives exactly as long as
                    that process. Windows: msvcrt.locking (byte 0, per handle,
                    released by the OS when the process ends) and no fd
                    inheritance — the reconciler takes the lock ITSELF at start
                    (retrying while the daemon lets go of its check-lock) and
                    the daemon only confirms it is held after spawning; a
                    reconciler that exits drops it and tick() restarts one.
  3. signal         POSIX: SIGTERM runs the exit sweep on the main thread.
                    Windows: os.kill / terminate() are TerminateProcess, no
                    handler ever runs, SIGKILL does not exist — so the sweep is
                    reached only through guarantee 1 (EOF or parent gone), off
                    the watch thread; the daemon stops its reconciler by closing
                    the child's stdin first and terminates only on timeout, and
                    shell/daemon.js does the same to the daemon (stdin.end(),
                    wait, kill). A new reconcile round can start during that
                    off-main-thread sweep; what it leaves behind is what the
                    next start's startup sweep + reap_dead_inflight exist for.
  Also: <base>/current is a junction (no symlink privilege needed);
  Win32_Process carries no cwd, so an orphan reconciler is recognised by this
  install's own script on its command line (one install, one workspace).

Import-safe (the cloud updater imports every runtime module as a health
check): nothing runs until main().
