"""Account reader: pull live equity/positions from every connected exchange.

Writes workspace/manager/account.json; portfolio_reporter ships that file to
the backend on its own schedule. The split is deliberate (and is the whole
design): this file EXECUTES agent-written lib/account_{venue}.py code, the
reporter only reads JSON — so a hanging or crashing account module can never
take the portfolio report (halt state, heartbeats, positions) down with it,
and a read failure shows up as data ("error" below) instead of silence.

Runs under the system python3 as the agent user, NOT the runtime venv: the
account modules are agent-written workspace code whose dependencies the agent
installed into its own user-site (same interpreter the strategies run on).

Transport note: REST polling per tick. If a venue ever needs to be more
real-time, replace the writer for that venue with a websocket daemon writing
THE SAME account.json — reporter/backend/web never change.

    account.json, but os.replace above swaps the inode, and systemd's path
    matcher drops that event while the portfolio oneshot it triggers is still
    mid-run — so a just-bound venue sat blank for ~2 minutes until the timer
    caught up (measured on 29026). This closes that gap; the .path unit /
    file_watcher stay as the backstop.

    Runs the reporter BLOCKING (subprocess.run, not a detached Popen). This
    reader is a Type=oneshot unit under the default KillMode=control-group: the
    instant main() exits, systemd SIGTERMs the whole cgroup — which includes any
    child we spawned. A detached Popen therefore got killed mid-POST before the
    report left the box (measured on 29026: control-group teardown reaped the
    child within 10s, the report never arrived; blocking here lets it finish).
    By waiting for the POST to complete before we exit, the child runs entirely
    within our lifetime and never meets the teardown — no systemd unit change,
    no KillMode=process, no sudoers needed. Cost: account.service takes ~1-3s
    longer per run, well inside its TimeoutStartSec=120, once a minute.

    Best-effort and idempotent: the reporter is stdlib-only — it only reads
    files and POSTs, writing no local state — so a run racing the timer just
    sends one more identical report, and it does not write
    account.json/last_reconcile.json, so it can't re-trigger this reader. Run
    under this reader's own interpreter (sys.executable): the reporter needs no
    venue deps, and BLAVE_PROXY_TOKEN is inherited from our environment (both
    launch paths carry it — account.service's EnvironmentFile and web.service,
    which hosts the retest listener). A failure or timeout here must never break
    the account read, so it is logged and swallowed.

    Linux only: on Windows there is no systemd, and file_watcher polls
    account.json's mtime (no inode-swap blind spot), so it already pushes the
    report reliably — a kick here would just double it.
