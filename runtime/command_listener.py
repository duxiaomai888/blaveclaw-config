"""Command listener: deterministic web → machine operations, no LLM turn.

Runs as its own thread inside web_bridge so that nothing it does waits on
anything else. That isolation is the whole point, not an optimisation: the
bridge's main loop runs an agent turn synchronously, and a turn can take
minutes — the exact window in which a user is most likely to hit 停止交易.
A stop that queues behind a turn is not a kill switch.

Every command here is a data write with no judgment in it, which is why it does
not go through the agent (see AGENTS.md "No LLM in the execution loop" — the
same reasoning, applied to the web side). Anything needing judgment (write me a
strategy, why did this die) stays in the chat.

`amounts` (per-strategy sizing) IS here: the web confirms the exact numbers
with the user before sending, and the reconciler—not this command—decides if
any order actually fires. Sending orders directly stays out.

Secrets: `credentials` carries an exchange key to the workspace .env. It is
never printed, never echoed, and never included in an error message.

# dependencies, not pandas/pyarrow/numpy/etc — those live in the system
# python strategies already run under (same one run_strategy.sh/cron always
# used). Importing wait_for_bar.py in-process would mean _check_freshness's
# `fetch_data()` call executing INSIDE this runtime's process with none of a
# strategy's actual dependencies available — every real strategy would
# ModuleNotFoundError immediately. This isn't a workaround for that gap: it's
# the same boundary _execution_engine_ready() elsewhere in this file already
# documents for a different command ("String probe, never an import —
# importing runs workspace code inside the listener"), applied consistently
# here too. Subprocess dispatch still gets everything the 定案方案 asked

# (desktop) is — so "when was I last alive" is the stop detector. A thread with
# nothing else to do stamps state/heartbeat/downtime_watch every few seconds; a
# stamp older than the workspace's own floor means the machine, the app or the
# process was away for that long (sleep, VM stop, app closed, crash). Whether
# that crossed a bar close — and the pause itself — is lib/downtime's call,
# reached through a subprocess like every other piece of workspace code.
# No stamp at all = this feature has never run here = NOT a stop: the first
# start after the runtime update must not pause a fleet that was never down.
# lib/downtime.runtime_supports() byte-greps THIS file for the assignment
# below before it ever pauses anything — a runtime without the per-strategy
# resume handlers and the whole-machine clear above could not get a machine
# back out. It stands for those handlers: remove them, remove it.

    one or more rounds, down to dust below the reconcile threshold, provided
    the venue lib ships a spot layer (`order.get_spot_balances`). The venue is
    inherited from existing members
    (one portfolio, one account — membership never silently splits across
    venues). Only a key's ABSENCE (unpicked in the picker) drops routing —
    amount=0 must NOT drop it, or the reconciler (and Capital's
    _is_capital_routed venue-detection, which reads `exchanges` alone) loses
