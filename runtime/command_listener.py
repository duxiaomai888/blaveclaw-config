"""Command listener: deterministic web → machine operations, no LLM turn.

Runs as its own thread inside web_bridge so that nothing it does waits on
anything else. That isolation is the whole point, not an optimisation: the
bridge's main loop runs an agent turn synchronously, and a turn can take
minutes — the exact window in which a user is most likely to hit 停止交易.
A stop that queues behind a turn is not a kill switch.

Every command here is a data write with no judgment in it, which is why it does
not go through the agent (see AGENTS.md "No LLM in the execution loop" — the
same reasoning, applied to the web side). Anything needing judgment (write me a
strategy, why did this die) stays in the chat.

`amounts` (per-strategy sizing) IS here: the web confirms the exact numbers
with the user before sending, and the reconciler—not this command—decides if
any order actually fires. Sending orders directly stays out.

Secrets: `credentials` carries an exchange key to the workspace .env. It is
never printed, never echoed, and never included in an error message.

    Merge for everything EXCEPT other venues' credentials: .env also holds

    venue per machine is the designed case — TW brokers included. Binding
    venue X evicts every other venue's credentials in the same write, or a
    Binance→BingX switch leaves BINANCE_* behind and puts the machine on
    venue_wiring.detect_venue's multiple-venues warning path. Evicted =
    complete credential PAIRS only ({ID}_API_KEY with an {ID}_SECRET_KEY /
    {ID}_PASSWORD / {ID}_PASSPHRASE sibling) — that shape IS the previously
    bound venue(s); singleton service keys (OPENAI_API_KEY — no secret sibling),
    venue support keys (SINOPAC_CA_PATH), user-added lines and comments all
    survive, deliberately. DATA_<SOURCE>_* lines (data-source keys) also
    survive every bind — and are refused as a payload: that prefix is never a
    venue, so writing one here would be a bind nothing can see.

    Also the chat-bind path: blave-agent's lib/venue.py loads this module
    from <base>/current and calls _in_workspace(_cmd_credentials, {"env": …})
    and reads _venue_cred_ids over .env — keep those names and shapes stable.

    A Binance payload is checked against the exchange first
    (_binance_bind_check) — in EVERY mode, so the web 連接交易所 flow and the
    desktop connect screen both go through it, since all of them end here
    (Wei 2026-09-22). Two consequences for the web path, which previously
    wrote whatever it was handed: a key with no trading permission is now
    refused, and a bind fails when Binance cannot be reached from the machine
    (fail-closed — the user retries). Everything that is not Binance (paper,
    OKX, Gate.io, Bybit, BingX, the TW brokers, data-source keys) is untouched:
    no call, same behaviour as before — except OKX, BingX and Bybit, whose
    key's withdrawal permission is refused in every mode (_withdraw_gate), and
    the desktop, where those plus Gate.io first pass _local_real_key_gate.

    Ack shape (`_send_ack`). Success: `result` = {"credentials": N, "binance":
    {"checked": true, "code": "OK"|"NO_IP_RESTRICT", "ipRestrict", "spot",
    "futures"} | null, "book_account"?: {venue: "ok"|"reset"|"unreadable"|
    "transient"}} — `book_account` = what the bind-time account-id read decided
    for each venue's book (_bind_book_accounts; absent when nothing was read);
    `binance` is null when the payload was not a Binance
    bind, and a runtime that predates this returns the STRING "credentials=N"
    instead, which is how a caller tells "not checked here" from "checked and
    clean" (the app labels an unchecked bind honestly rather than claiming a
    verdict it never got). `ipRestrict` is reported, never enforced: a key with
    no whitelist binds, the caller only warns. Refusal: `ok:false` and `error`
    = "ValueError: <CODE>: <text>", CODE being
    WITHDRAW_ENABLED, TRADING_DISABLED, INCOMPLETE_PAIR, or one of binance_check.js's

# Replaces "N * * * * wait_for_bar.py <name>" crontab entries with a plain
# while-loop on this thread: command_listener is already a long-lived daemon
# thread (see module docstring), so there is no reason for it to write itself
# a system-cron reminder instead of just looping — the scheduling/timing logic
# lives here, in-process, exactly per the 定案方案.
#
# What does NOT live here: wait_for_bar.py's own freshness-check code
# (_tick/_check_freshness). Each tick below shells out to the unmodified CLI
# entrypoint (`python3 manager/wait_for_bar.py <name>`, PATH-resolved
# interpreter) instead of importing it — confirmed on a real machine while
# building this: /opt/blave-agent/venv (this runtime's own environment, ships
# via this repo's publish.py) carries only the Claude Agent SDK's own
# dependencies, not pandas/pyarrow/numpy/etc — those live in the system
# python strategies already run under (same one run_strategy.sh/cron always
# used). Importing wait_for_bar.py in-process would mean _check_freshness's
# `fetch_data()` call executing INSIDE this runtime's process with none of a
# strategy's actual dependencies available — every real strategy would
# ModuleNotFoundError immediately. This isn't a workaround for that gap: it's
# the same boundary _execution_engine_ready() elsewhere in this file already
# documents for a different command ("String probe, never an import —
# importing runs workspace code inside the listener"), applied consistently
# here too. Subprocess dispatch still gets everything the 定案方案 asked
# for — no crontab writes, no guessed cadence, in-process timing + wake +
# migration, per-strategy parallelism — plus process isolation the in-process
# design would not have had (a broken strategy.py can't take this process
# down with it).

SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 60  # matches wait_for_bar.py's own cron cadence
# Generous: fetch_data() can legitimately take minutes (wait_for_bar.py's own
# cost-note docstring) on top of the strategy run's own 600s budget inside
# it — 1200 would be tight. Matches wait_for_bar.py's LOCK_STALE_SECONDS, so
# by the time this would actually fire, that file's own stale-lock recovery

    what the user typed is what trades, and it never drifts with equity.
    Doubles as membership: a strategy KEY present in `amounts` (any value,

    portfolio and routes it. Flattening mechanics differ by market: futures
    read `actual` from a live exchange position query every round, so amount=0
    closes it out directly; spot has no such blanket query and instead relies
    on `lib/portfolio.spot_scope`'s persisted-scope sell-down (the same
    exit-on-removal path a dropped strategy takes) — it converges to flat over
    one or more rounds, down to dust below the reconcile threshold, provided
    the venue lib ships a spot layer (`order.get_spot_balances`). The venue is
    inherited from existing members
    (one portfolio, one account — membership never silently splits across
    venues). Only a key's ABSENCE (unpicked in the picker) drops routing —
