"""
Portfolio reporter: ships the machine's portfolio state to the Blave backend
(POST /openclaw/agent/portfolio) so the workspace's 投資組合 view can render
without a VM round-trip — the same report/read split strategy_reporter.py uses.

What it collects, and why each piece has to come from here:
  - manager/portfolio_config.json  weights / leverage / capital / exchange routing
  - strategies/<n>/state.json      each strategy's live signal + when it last moved
  - crontab + state/deployments.json
                                   whether a strategy is actually SCHEDULED; a
                                   weighted strategy with no schedule trades on
                                   a frozen signal and nothing else notices.
                                   Two sources because Type A/C strategies get
                                   NO crontab/schtasks entry at all — see
                                   scheduled_strategies()
  - manager/last_reconcile.json    the only record of real exchange positions
                                   (written by lib/portfolio.reconcile)
  - manager/orders.jsonl           what was actually sent to the exchange
  - manager/account.json           live equity/positions per venue, written by
                                   account_reader.py — read as JSON, never
                                   executed; a broken account module shows up
                                   as that file's "error" field, not as this
                                   report dying
  - state/heartbeat/reconciler     is the auto-trader alive
  - state/events.jsonl             機器側 P1／P2 事件(events.py):平台落
                                   agent_event 再依級別 fan-out,回應的
                                   acked_through 是這個檔的水位線
  - 磁碟／記憶體／gateway、配對的 chat id
                                   平台每小時 SSH 進機器巡檢的那支掃描退役後,
                                   這幾件事只剩這條路上來(resources /
