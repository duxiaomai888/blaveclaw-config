"""One-shot heal of the workspace's kline2 cache, run by portfolio_reporter after a report.

Until 2026-10-01 api /kline returned a partial bar one day past end_date (5m/1m base
resampled up to the next day's 00:00). lib/data.py before VERSION 2026-10-01 merged it
into past-month parquets under cache/kline2_*, which that lib never re-fetches. The lib
fix renamed the namespace to kline3, but lib only reaches machines whose workspace was
updated; this reaches every machine through the runtime channel.

Nothing is deleted or rewritten: each affected past-month file gets its mtime set back
to the first instant of its month. lib's _written_before_month_end (VERSION 2026-08-11
and later) reads that as "cached mid-month" and answers with one completing re-fetch,
merged keep='last', so the fixed api's bars replace the stray ones. A reader mid-call
sees the file either way; nothing disappears under a live round. The cost lands on the
next read of a flagged dir: every flagged past month in the requested range is
fetched again (in practice START to last month), once.

Which files: past months only (the current month is delta-updated by lib anyway), last
written before the cutoff and not an empty-month marker (no rows, cannot hold a stray
bar). In 1-minute / 5-minute dirs (any spelling: 1m, 1min, 5T…) the stray bar was a
complete base bar, harmless inside a month; there only a near-empty file is flagged — a
batch cold fetch ending on a month's last day wrote the stray bar alone into the next
month's file, which then passes as complete.

Pacing, so the re-fetch never lands fleet-wide or dir-wide on one bar close: each machine
waits a random 0-STAGGER_MAX_S before its first step, then flags at most DIRS_PER_STEP
dirs per STEP_S. A lib that cannot re-fetch (pre 2026-08-11) or no longer reads kline2
(kline3) is recorded and left alone.

State in state/kline2_heal.json, forwarded in the portfolio report as `kline2_heal`. A
step is claimed in that file before any file is touched, so a state dir that cannot be
written means no heal at all, never an unbounded rescan.
