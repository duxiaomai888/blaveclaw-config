Strategy reporter: scans the agent's workspace/strategies/ and reports the

    Two ways it differs from the columns signature() builds, both load-bearing:

    1. The image set is part of it. Images travel out of band (attach_images uploads
       them and writes only references into the report), so a strategy whose only change
       is a new pnl.png has identical stats/scan/wf markers — and with an unchanged
       marker this reporter would never send it, and the picture would never reach the
       workspace.
    2. stats.json is tracked by mtime+size even when the strategy is live/deployed.
       _stats_marker's "exists" exemption belongs to signature() and must stay there: it
       stops a per-bar stats.json rewrite from triggering a full scan + a live chunk +
       a workspace redraw mid-conversation once a bar. It must NOT be merged into this
       one. Until now the timer re-sent the whole inventory unconditionally every two
       minutes, so a deployed strategy's fresh numbers reached the cache anyway; under
       incremental reporting an "exists" marker never changes, and the cache would
       freeze permanently for exactly the users with real money running.
    3. The strategy's own CONTENT is in it (_content_marker). The three file markers
       above only watch the backtest OUTPUTS; the strategy file itself is not one of
       them. An agent that edits the code without re-running the backtest, and every
       Type B strategy (which never backtests at all), would otherwise be frozen in the
       platform's copy from the first report onwards — the workspace would show code
       nobody has run since.
