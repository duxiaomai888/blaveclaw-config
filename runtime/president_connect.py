"""統一期貨 (President) cloud connect: the deterministic machine side.

Same shape as runtime/capital_connect.py (whose one-time key, envelope and ACL
helpers it reuses): every step is a command with a fixed outcome, the outcome is
written to state/president_connect.json, and the portfolio report carries it as
`president_connect` — the one status the web reads. Nothing goes through the
agent. Windows cloud boxes only in v1.

Steps, in the order the page walks them:
  credentials        the 自動下單 form (command_listener._cmd_credentials →
                     divert_credentials here): account + trading password.
                     The password goes to the vault, .env gets sentinels, the
                     fixed certificate path and BOTH hosts (president_url and
                     president_test_url), so switching environments never
                     rewrites .env. A new account starts in the TEST
                     environment ("live": false); a rebind of the same account
                     keeps the one it was in; a president_url in the bind picks
                     one explicitly (normalize_host).
  president_setup    unitrade (pinned) into the worker's python; cryptography
                     into this one (the envelope and the pfx check run here).
  president_pfx_key  one-time RSA key; the ack carries the public half.
  president_pfx      {key_id, envelope}: the user's .pfx + its password, sealed
                     in the browser. Opened and checked HERE (a wrong password
                     never reaches the broker — the SDK sends the trading
                     password before it opens the certificate, so a bad pfx
                     would cost a login try), then stored as
                     credentials/president.pfx (fixed name: the user's file
                     name carries the national id), its password into the
                     vault; then one read-only login (the probe).
  president_pfx_local {key_id, envelope}: the certificate the user applied for
                     themselves over RDP (logged in as Administrator, in
                     憑證e總管). The envelope carries only the password ("pfx"
                     must be ""; a file in it is refused, not ignored). The
                     newest file in LOCAL_CERT_DIR (Administrator's PSCCA) the
                     password opens and that has not expired is COPIED to
                     credentials/president.pfx — the original stays for next
                     year's renewal — then the same vault write and probe as
                     president_pfx. Only the platform copies from PSCCA; no
                     code here runs, drives or logs in to 憑證e總管.
  president_probe    `lib/president_worker.py --once`: the user's 「確認登入」 — one real
                     login, even after a failed one stopped logins (lib STOP).
                     Logs in to whichever environment is current.
  president_host     {"env": "test"|"live"} or {"url": <as the user pasted it>}:
                     switch environments (the vault's "live"), then the probe.
                     統一 opens production API access only after the user
                     placed one order on the TEST host with the test account
                     their broker mailed (same password, same certificate) and
                     reported it; "營業員說開好了" is {"env": "live"}. Only the
                     two hosts in HOSTS are accepted. Switching to test removes
                     the worker service and the account snapshot.
  president_test_order  test environment only: one TMF near-month market IOC buy
                     through runtime/president_test_order.py (see there for why
                     IOC); its time and order number are what the user reads to
                     the broker.
  president_finish   `lib/president_worker.py --install` (NSSM, LocalSystem);
                     only after a probe passed on the PRODUCTION host.

Any other way to get the certificate onto the machine is one more command that
ends where president_pfx ends: the `cert` section with its own `source`, then
the same probe and finish. Add its name to COMMANDS and _JOBS, and to the api
allow-list.

Vault (<base>/credentials/president_vault.json, = lib/president_vault.VAULT)
and president.pfx: SYSTEM + Administrators only. Unlike 群益's, both must be
readable by SYSTEM: the worker runs as LocalSystem, the reconciler as
Administrator. On a cloud box the agent's shell is SYSTEM too, so this keeps the
secrets and the production switch out of .env and out of the agent's ordinary
paths — it is not a wall against SYSTEM set on bypassing it.

Never put a secret, a pfx byte, a certificate subject (it carries the national
id) or a broker message into a return value, an exception, the status or a log.
